    <b>Is There Any Overlap Between Six Month Java Releases?</b><br>
    <small>By Jim Connors - 19 March 2019</small><br>
    <br>
    With the <a href="https://mreinhold.org/blog/forward-faster">introduction
      of the new release cadence</a>,&nbsp; the Java community has made
    good on its promise to deliver innovation at an accelerated
    pace.&nbsp; Starting with the release of JDK 9 back in September
    2017, today, 19 March 2019, marks the general availability (GA) of <a
      href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/12/">JDK 12</a> -- the
    fourth such six month release that has arrived, without slippage, on
    its expected delivery date.&nbsp; For those wishing to adopt these
    new releases as they become available, one of the more common
    concerns revolves around the apparent lack of overlap between
    releases.&nbsp; That is to say, once a six month release begins its
    support and update lifecycle, the previous version ends
    abruptly.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    From a security perspective, there actually is an overlap.&nbsp; The
    GA date for the six month releases are deliberately placed in
    between planned quarterly updates (scheduled each year in January,
    April, July and October).&nbsp; As a result, <i>there is about a
      month's time where both old and new releases are at the same
      security baseline</i>.&nbsp; If we use JDK 12 as an example,
    introduced on 19 March, it will not receive a security update until
    16 April.&nbsp; In the interim, there is no security difference
    between JDK 11 and JDK 12.&nbsp; That duration can serve as a
    transition and testing period where staying on JDK 11 does not
    sacrifice any security posture.&nbsp; The same overlap principle
    will hold true as newer JDK releases are introduced.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, in order to further assist in the transitioning
    between releases, early access builds are accessible far in advance
    of their GA date.&nbsp; For example, <a
      href="https://jdk.java.net/13/"
      data-cke-saved-href="https://jdk.java.net/13/">early access</a><a
      href="https://jdk.java.net/13/"> versions of JDK 13</a> have been
    available since February 2019, affording developers and testers many
    months of advance preparation before its planned September 2019
    release date.<br>
    <p>Perhaps less than ideal, the combination of having a month's
      worth of security baseline equivalence between old release and
      new, plus advance access to newer releases should assist those
      following the continuous integration paradigm with Java releases.</p>
