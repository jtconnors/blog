    <p> <big><b>JavaFX Book Arrives!</b></big><br>
      <small><small>By Jim Connors 10 June 2009</small></small><br>
    </p>
    <p>Since the beginning, the deadlines set forth for producing our <a
        href="http://jfxbook.com">book</a> have been aggressive to say
      the least.&nbsp; Ultimately, we wanted them to be physically
      available for sale at the JavaOne 2009 conference.&nbsp; These
      things arrived literally hot off the press, having been flown in
      the opening day of the show.&nbsp; This effort was not in vain;
      the results are in.&nbsp; According to our friends at Digital
      Guru, JavaFX was definitely the hot topic of the week and <a

          - Developing Rich Internet Applications</em></a> was the best
      seller.&nbsp; Furthermore as of 9:52AM Eastern Time 09-June-2009,
      Amazon reports that its sales rank is a very respectable
      21,873.&nbsp; Not bad for just a few days showing.<br>

    <p>These sales were no doubt fueled by Larry Ellison's cameo
      appearance during the first JavaOne keynote.&nbsp; Clearly
      hampered by what he could and could not say due to Oracle's
      pending acquisition of Sun, Larry went out of his way to promote
      the future of JavaFX.&nbsp; He must have mentioned it a half dozen
      times during his 10 minute or so appearance.&nbsp; On behalf of
      Eric and the other Jim, thanks bud.<br>
