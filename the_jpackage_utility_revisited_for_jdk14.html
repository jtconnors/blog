    <p><b>The jpackage Utility Revisited for JDK14</b><br>
      <font size="-1">by Jim Connors 1 June 2020</font><br>
    </p>
    <p>A <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/a-brief-example-using-the-early-access-jpackage-utility">previous&nbsp;post</a>&nbsp;of










      mine introduced and demonstrated&nbsp;<tt>jpackage</tt>, a utility
      that enables the packaging&nbsp;up of&nbsp;Java applications in
      native installer format for Windows, MacOS or&nbsp;Linux.&nbsp;
      Kindly disregard&nbsp;that&nbsp;post, and instead use
      the&nbsp;associated video in this article&nbsp;as a current
      reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;At the time of the original&nbsp;article's
      creation, it was in early prototype form and only available in a
      special build of JDK13.&nbsp; With the arrival of JDK14, <tt>jpackage</tt>
      has been formally incorporated into the JDK as an <a
        href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11">incubator module</a>
      called <tt>jdk.incubator.jpackage</tt>.&nbsp; The rationale for
      revisiting this topic lies in the fact that APIs
      have&nbsp;changed; in particular, the command-line arguments
      associated with&nbsp;the <tt>jpackage</tt> utility are different.</p>
    <p>The video that follows walks through the building of a sample
      modularized Java application, then proceeds to first create a <tt>jlink</tt>'ed










      runtime image of that application, before ultimately
      demonstrating&nbsp;how to use&nbsp;<tt>jpackage</tt>&nbsp;to
      create a Windows-native installer&nbsp;of that application. It
      then briefly shows how those same tasks can be performed on Linux
      and MacOS platforms too.</p>
    <p>In case the video frame doesn't appear correctly in this article,
      here's the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/fI4L9cT3FpU">https://youtu.be/fI4L9cT3FpU</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI4L9cT3FpU"

          bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0; margin: auto;"></a></p>
    <p>Considering its incubator status, it's possible that further
      (hopefully smaller) refinements may occur, based on user feedback,
      before the API&nbsp;is cast in stone.&nbsp; At which point it may
      may make sense to revisit yet again.</p>
