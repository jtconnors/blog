          Application</b></big><br>

    <p>As evidenced at the recently completed <a
        href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a> 2012
      conference, community excitement towards the <a
        href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and its
      potential as a Java development and deployment platform was
      readily palpable.&nbsp; Fast forward three months, Oracle has
      announced the availability of a <a
href="http://jdk8.java.net/fxarmpreview/javafx-arm-developer-preview.html">JDK


        8 (with JavaFX) for Arm Early Access Developer Preview</a> where
      the reference platform for this release is none other than the
      Raspberry Pi.</p>
    <p>What makes this especially interesting to me is the addition of
      JavaFX to the Java SE-Embedded 8 platform.&nbsp; It turns out that
      at $35US, the (not so) humble Raspberry Pi has a very capable
      graphics processor, opening up a Pandora's box of graphics
      applications that could be applied to this beloved device.&nbsp;
      As a first step in becoming familiar with just how this works, I
      decided to dust off a two year old JavaFX scoreboard application,
      originally written for a Windows laptop, and see how it would run
      on the Pi.&nbsp; Low and behold, the application runs unmodified
      (without even a recompile).</p>
    <p>The video that follows shows how an ordinary flat screen TV can
      be converted into a full screen electronic scoreboard driven by a
      Raspberry Pi.&nbsp; The requirements for such a solution are
      incredibly straightforward: (1) the TV needs access to a power
      receptacle and (2) it must be within range of a WiFi network in
      order to receive scoreboard update packets.&nbsp; The device is so
      compact and miserly from a power perspective, that we velcro the
      Pi to the back of the TV and get our power from the TV's USB port.
      If you can spare a few moments, it just might be worth your while
      to take a look.<br>
