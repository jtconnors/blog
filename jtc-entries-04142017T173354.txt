If not already, certainly very soon, the number of devices connected to the Internet will exceed the human population on planet Earth.&nbsp; With this phenomenon, referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things"><i>Internet of Things</i></a>, one famous prediction states that the number of addressable devices will reach 50 billion in the not too distant future.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>As the potential for Java is fully realized in the burgeoning M2M (Machine to Machine) market, a new group of decision makers, developers and administrators, perhaps not entirely familiar with this technology, will likely be brought into the fold.&nbsp; On more than one occasion recently, we've heard suitors ask a question 
similar to the following:&nbsp; &quot;We understand that Java has some inherent 
security advantages.&nbsp; Can you explain what you mean by that?&quot;</p> 
  <p>Much has been written about Java security, some in excruciating detail.&nbsp; The standard online Java 7 documentation set contains a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/">Java security section</a>.&nbsp; And <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Security-Edition-Scott-Oaks/dp/0596001576/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355375150&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=java+security">Scott Oaks' <i>Java Security</i> book</a>, even dated, is still an excellent and relevant reference for understanding this subject.&nbsp; What follows is a high-level overview of Java security designed to be read and digested in the few moments it takes to read this article.</p> 
  <p>Security considerations have been built in to the Java platform on many levels, from the syntax of the programming language itself to the behavior of the runtime environment to the add-on capabilities that can be plugged in to further enhance security.&nbsp; So let's look at it from those perspectives.</p> 
  <p> <b>Java Language Security Features</b>: From the outset, developer productivity and security were given top priority by the Java designers when considering Java programming language syntax.&nbsp; In many cases, the goals of these two priorities are quite complimentary.&nbsp; That is to say, the consequences of introducing a construct to enhance productivity often brought with it the benefit of added security.&nbsp; In general, it is much more difficult to exploit traditional security weaknesses found in older languages like C and C++.&nbsp; For example, Java:<br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>Automatically performs range checking on array references</b> - by default, every array reference is automatically checked by the Java runtime to make sure that it falls within the range of the size of the array.&nbsp; This feature not only enables the developer to more easily diagnose errors, but virtually eliminates the chances of the dreaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">buffer overflow</a>, the culprit behind many a security exploit.&nbsp; In the name of performance, some languages (C,C++) do no range checking at all, and fall prey to all sorts of problems.</li> 
    <li><b>Eliminates pointers</b> - pointers avail developers with the sharpest of double-edged swords.&nbsp; They indeed provide great power to the developer, but also the potential to wreak tremendous havoc by allowing arbitrary access to a program's memory.&nbsp; There are no pointers in Java; thus the class of errors associated with that feature are greatly diminished.</li> 
    <li><b>Performs extensive compile-time checking</b> - Java, as a statically typed programming language is strict in the way it allows the mixing of different data types.&nbsp; The end result is a lot of potential problems will be flagged as errors by the Java compiler at compile time, forcing the developer to fix the conflict then and there.&nbsp; Other languages deemed more dynamically typed, are more permissive of certain constructs.&nbsp; Previously uncaught errors and security vulnerabilities are exposed here only during program execution.&nbsp; These types of errors are much harder to find and much more expensive to fix.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><b>Bytecode Verification</b>: Java source code is compiled down to binary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file">class files</a> consisting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java bytecodes</a>.&nbsp; When external class files are loaded into the Java Runtime Environment for execution, they are first examined by the bytecode verifier to see that the sequence of bytecodes are well behaved.&nbsp; The Java compiler does a great job of making sure data access is done in an appropriate manner and hence prevents many malevolent bytecode sequences from ever occurring.&nbsp; But what if someone were to construct a Java class file by hand bypassing the Java compiler and its strict rules?&nbsp; That's where the bytecode verifier comes into play.&nbsp; Among many other capabilities, the verifier will check to make sure branch instructions point to an appropriate contextual address and furthermore that data access is always type-safe.&nbsp; For a more detailed description of verification specifics, check out the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.2.2">Bytecode Verifier section in the Java Virtual Machine Specification documentation</a>.</p> 
  <p><b>The Sandbox</b>: Untrusted Java applications, applets and class files that are retrieved from external sources (e.g. the Internet), are run in such a way that they have no access to critical system resources.&nbsp; The computer science and security community often times refers to this construct as a <a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/security/ch01_02.htm">sandbox</a>.&nbsp; As one of many possible examples, access to a computer or device's local file system would be forbidden in this mode of operation.&nbsp; Programs written with malicious intent or those that are just plain poorly written, would have minimal impact within the confines of the sandbox since they cannot get at any of the components deemed vital.&nbsp; A highly restrictive sandbox lends itself to a secure environment, but also one of limited functionality too.&nbsp; So the question arises: What if you need to provide additional permissions outside the default sandbox for an application?&nbsp; The answer lies in extending Java's SecurityManager which we'll touch on next.</p> 
  <p><b>The SecurityManager</b>: With the addition of a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html">SecurityManager</a> object, you can define a custom security policy for your application.&nbsp; The SecurityManager serves as a sentry, inspecting any operation that could be deemed dangerous prior to allowing that operation to take place.&nbsp; If the operation in question is not permitted, the SecurityManager will throw a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityException.html">SecurityException</a>, indicating a security violation.&nbsp; If the operation is allowed, the SecurityManager will silently return without throwing an exception.&nbsp; With this mechanism in place, one or more policy configuration files can be created to specify what resources an application has legitimate access to.&nbsp; Within these policy configuration files, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Permission.html">Permission</a> objects can be defined.&nbsp; By no means exhaustive, custom permissions can be associated with resources, such as:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>File system access</li> 
    <li>Network socket access</li> 
    <li>Ability to use Java features like Serialization and Reflection</li> 
    <li>Access to system resources like windows and print queues</li> 
    <li>Ability to manage the Java Virtual Machine instance<br /></li> 
    <li>Access to other Java classes and packages</li> 
    <li>Access to other thread groups</li> 
    <li>And much, much more!</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><b>Cryptographic Framework</b>:&nbsp; This topic is worthy of it own voluminous publication, the Java platform provides cryptographic engines for the components needed to support full cryptography.&nbsp; These include authentication, encryption, message digests, digital signatures plus key and digital certificate management.&nbsp; Although default implementations of the various ingredients are provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK), the platform is architected in such a way that you have the option of providing alternative implementations.</p> 
  <p><b>Java Security is Continually Evolving</b>: No platform has been proven perfectly secure, and due to the complexities involved, likely never will.&nbsp; The cat-and-mouse game behind finding and fixing security exploits will be with us long into the future.&nbsp; Understanding this fact, Java security must (and will) continue to evolve.&nbsp; Major Java updates often bring with them significant enhancements to security.&nbsp; Here's a list of planned <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/features">features for Java 8</a>, a good number of which have security ramifications.&nbsp; Furthermore, periodic updates also address security concerns too.&nbsp; Java 7 update 10, as discussed in <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/oracle_jdk_7u10_released_with">Henrik Stahl's blog</a>, contains a few interesting security enhancements including:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Being able to track if the installed version of the Java runtime is updated to the latest security baseline.&nbsp; If the runtime is not at the latest level, the user will be warned if an attempt to run an unsigned applet takes place.<br /></li> 
    <li>Providing a &quot;best used before date&quot;.&nbsp; Assuming periodic security updates will take place, if the runtime hasn't been checked for an update prior to this expiration date, the runtime will assume it's in an insecure state and warn the user.</li> 
    <li>The ability from the Java Control Panel UI to quickly set a low-medium-high-very high security level<br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>In summary, the <i>write once run anywhere</i> capabilities of Java make it an ideal common platform for M2M devices as they increase in functionality and connectivity.&nbsp; Security, both in it's current from, and as it continues to evolve, is yet another of the additional benefits derived by the Java platform.<br /> </p>

TITLE: Subversion in a Solaris Zone

BODY: 
1. Create a Solaris zone called 'svn'<br /><p><i>Note: This step
is system specific.&nbsp; For example, the hostname and IP address for
'svn' was predefined.&nbsp; In addition, the network interface (i.e.
'set physical=iprb0') is likely to be different also.</i><br />
<br />
Here's the command-line session for creating the zone:<br />
</p><pre>phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">mkdir /zone</span><br />phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zonecfg -z svn</span><br />svn: No such zone configured<br />Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.<br />zonecfg:svn&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">create</span><br />zonecfg:svn&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set zonepath=/zone/svn</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>zonecfg:svn&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set autoboot=true</span><br />zonecfg:svn&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">add net</span><br />zonecfg:svn:net&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set address=svn</span><br />zonecfg:svn:net&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set physical=iprb0</span><br />zonecfg:svn:net&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br />zonecfg:svn&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">info</span><br />zonepath: /zone/svn<br />autoboot: true<br />pool:<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /lib<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /platform<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /sbin<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /usr<br />net:<br />        address: svn<br />        physical: iprb0<br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">verify</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">commit</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">\^D<br /><br /></span>phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zoneadm list -vc</span><br />  ID NAME             STATUS         PATH<br />   0 global           running        /<br />   - svn              configured     /zone/svn<br /><br />phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zoneadm -z svn</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> install</span><br />Preparing to install zone &lt;svn&gt;.<br />Creating list of files to copy from the global zone.<br />Copying &lt;6666&gt; files to the zone.<br />Initializing zone product registry.<br />Determining zone package initialization order.<br />Preparing to initialize &lt;945&gt; packages on the zone.<br />Initialized &lt;945&gt; packages on zone.<br />Zone &lt;svn&gt; is initialized.<br />Installation of &lt;2&gt; packages was skipped.<br />Installation of these packages generated warnings: &lt;SUNWcsu SUNWsogm&gt;<br />The file &lt;/zone/svn/root/var/sadm/system/logs/install_log&gt; contains a log of the zone installation.<br /></pre>2.&nbsp; Configure the zone.<br />
<br />
2a. Create a zone-specific /usr/local directory and copy the contents of
the
global zone's /usr/local to this new directory.&nbsp; This is required because by default, /usr/local is read-only in a local zone.&nbsp; So let's create our own local version so that we can add to it.<br />
<pre style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://#</span> mkdir -p /zone/svn/usr/local<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://#</span> cd /usr/local<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://#</span> tar cf - . | (cd /zone/svn/usr/local; tar xfp -)<br /></pre>
2b. Create a loopback mount for toolzone to this new version of
/usr/local:<br />
<pre><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://</span># <span style="font-weight: bold;">zonecfg -z svn</span><br />zonecfg:svn&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">addfs</span><br />zonecfg:svn:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set dir=/usr/local</span><br />zonecfg:svn:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set special=/zone/svn</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">/usr/local</span><br />zonecfg:svn:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set type=lofs</span><br />zonecfg:svn:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br />zonecfg:svn&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">\^D</span><br /></pre>
2c. Boot and configure the newly created zone:<br />
<pre>phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zoneadm -z svn</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> boot</span><br />phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zlogin -C svn</span><!--<--><br /><br /></pre><p>2d. Further configuration/customization of the zone is left as an exercise to the user.</p><p>3. The <a title="SunFreeware" href="http://sunfreeware.com">SunFreeware</a> website contains many versions of popular open source applications that are available for the Solaris platform.&nbsp; For this exercise, we'll base our installation on subversion-1.4.4 which can be found <a href="http://sunfreeware.com/indexintel10.html">here</a>. Versions change quickly, and it is fully expected that in the future the dependent versions will become out of date.&nbsp; </p><p>There are a good number of software packages that are needed by subversion.&nbsp; The <a href="http://sunfreeware.com/subversion.html">additional installation packages</a> can be better understood by taking a look at the aforementioned link.</p><p>3a. Install within the svn zone all of the packages listed at the sunfreeware link above.&nbsp; They should be:</p><pre>   neon-0.25.5<br />   apache-2.0.59<br />   swig-1.3.29<br />   expat-1.95.5<br />   gdbm-1.8.3<br />   libxml2-2.6.26<br />   db-4.2.52.NC<br />   openssl-0.9.8e<br />   libiconv-1.11<br />   zlib-1.2.3<br />   libgcc-3.4.6<br />   subversion-1.4.4<br /><br /></pre><p>The downloadable packages are gzip'ed and in Solaris pkg format.&nbsp; For example, to install the first package, neon-0.25.5, download the appropriate Solaris 10 package (i.e. neon-0.25.5-so10-x86.local.gz), gunzip(1) it and pkgadd(1M) it.</p><pre>svn://# <b>gunzip neon-0.25.5-so10-x86.local.gz</b><br />svn://# <b>pkgadd -d &nbsp;neon-0.25.5-so10-x86.local</b><br /></pre><p>repeat for all of the required packages.</p><p>3b.&nbsp; You can confirm that things are at least marginally ok by issuing the following command:</p><pre>svn://# <b>ldd /usr/local/bin/svn</b><br />        libsvn_client-1.so.0 =&gt;  /usr/local/lib/libsvn_client-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_wc-1.so.0 =&gt;      /usr/local/lib/libsvn_wc-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_ra-1.so.0 =&gt;      /usr/local/lib/libsvn_ra-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_diff-1.so.0 =&gt;    /usr/local/lib/libsvn_diff-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_ra_local-1.so.0 =&gt;        /usr/local/lib/libsvn_ra_local-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_repos-1.so.0 =&gt;   /usr/local/lib/libsvn_repos-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_fs-1.so.0 =&gt;      /usr/local/lib/libsvn_fs-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_fs_fs-1.so.0 =&gt;   /usr/local/lib/libsvn_fs_fs-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_fs_base-1.so.0 =&gt;         /usr/local/lib/libsvn_fs_base-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_ra_svn-1.so.0 =&gt;  /usr/local/lib/libsvn_ra_svn-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_ra_dav-1.so.0 =&gt;  /usr/local/lib/libsvn_ra_dav-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_delta-1.so.0 =&gt;   /usr/local/lib/libsvn_delta-1.so.0<br />        libsvn_subr-1.so.0 =&gt;    /usr/local/lib/libsvn_subr-1.so.0<br />        libaprutil-0.so.0 =&gt;     /usr/local/lib/libaprutil-0.so.0<br />        libdb-4.2.so =&gt;  /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.2/lib/libdb-4.2.so<br />        libiconv.so.2 =&gt;         /usr/local/lib/libiconv.so.2<br />        libapr-0.so.0 =&gt;         /usr/local/lib/libapr-0.so.0<br />        libsendfile.so.1 =&gt;      /usr/lib/libsendfile.so.1<br />        librt.so.1 =&gt;    /usr/lib/librt.so.1<br />        libm.so.2 =&gt;     /usr/lib/libm.so.2<br />        libresolv.so.2 =&gt;        /usr/lib/libresolv.so.2<br />        libpthread.so.1 =&gt;       /usr/lib/libpthread.so.1<br />        libneon.so.25 =&gt;         /usr/local/lib/libneon.so.25<br />        libssl.so.0.9.8 =&gt;       /usr/local/ssl/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8<br />        libcrypto.so.0.9.8 =&gt;    /usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8<br />        libnsl.so.1 =&gt;   /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1<br />        libexpat.so.0 =&gt;         /usr/local/lib/libexpat.so.0<br />        libsocket.so.1 =&gt;        /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1<br />        libz.so =&gt;       /usr/local/lib/libz.so<br />        libc.so.1 =&gt;     /usr/lib/libc.so.1<br />        libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt;         /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.so.1<br />        libaio.so.1 =&gt;   /lib/libaio.so.1<br />        libmd5.so.1 =&gt;   /lib/libmd5.so.1<br />        libdl.so.1 =&gt;    /lib/libdl.so.1<br />        libmp.so.2 =&gt;    /lib/libmp.so.2<br />        libscf.so.1 =&gt;   /lib/libscf.so.1<br />        libdoor.so.1 =&gt;  /lib/libdoor.so.1<br />        libuutil.so.1 =&gt;         /lib/libuutil.so.1<br /></pre><p>In this example, all required shared objects should be found.</p><p>&nbsp;4. Assuming all goes swimmingly to this point, you'll need to modify the following configuration file, /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf, in order to use subversion with apache.&nbsp; You should append these to the LoadModule section of the file:</p><pre>LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so<br />LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so&nbsp;</pre><p>5.<br />&nbsp;</p><pre>&nbsp;</pre><p><br /></p><pre><br /></pre>

BODY: 
<p>With the upcoming release of&nbsp;<a href="https://jdk9.java.net/">JDK9</a>,
 the Java SE platform will cease to exist in monolith fashion and will 
instead be built from the ground up as a series of modules. &nbsp;This sea 
change will allow developers to modularize their own applications and 
furthermore enable them to create runtime images with only those modules
 that are required to run their application.&nbsp; Much has been, and 
certainly will be, written about this massive evolution.&nbsp; Today we'll 
focus on the ability to create custom runtime images and how their 
creation might be automated by an Integrated Development Environment 
like <a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>.</p> 
  <p>First off you can <a href="https://jdk9.java.net/download/">download an&nbsp;early access build of JDK9</a> and a <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/download/trunk/nightly/latest/">corresponding early access JDK9 NetBeans build</a> to get started.</p> 
  <p>For this recipe, we'll create a very simple JDK9 application called <em>SimpleApp</em> which just a logs a message using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">Java Logging API</a>. &nbsp;All Java 9 programs require the use of a module called <tt>java.base;</tt>&nbsp;the
 rationale behind choosing to invoke a logging method in this program is
 that it will require the module system to pull in an additional module 
called <tt>java.logging</tt>. &nbsp;Here's what the NetBeans project and source code look like:</p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppJava.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 345px;" /><br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><br />
When we run this program in NetBeans the output window shows this:<br /> <br /> </p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppOutput.jpg" height="162" width="445" /> </p> 
  <p><br />

    To modularize this program, the first thing we'll need to identify
    is its module dependencies.&nbsp; We can accomplish this task by
    taking advantage of a JDK9 utility called <tt>jdeps</tt> as
    follows:<br /> <br /> <img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppJdeps.jpg" height="342" width="677" /><br /> </p> 
  <p>First we we first just invoke <tt>jdeps


      -version</tt> to confirm that indeed we're using a JDK9 version of the tool<font face="monospace">. </font><tt><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></tt>Next we invoke <tt>jdeps -s</tt> on the
    NetBeans generated <tt>SimpleApp.jar</tt> file to get its module
    dependencies.&nbsp; In this instance, our program requires two
    modules.&nbsp; As briefly mentioned earlier, all Java 9 applications
    by default require the <tt>java.base</tt> module.&nbsp;
    Additionally our simple program calls a method in the <tt>java.logging</tt>
    module and hence has a dependency on it too.</p> 
  <p>

    With this information, we can introduce a <tt>module-info.java</tt> file into
    our NetBeans project by right clicking on the <em>SimpleApp</em> project and
    selecting <em>New-&gt;Java Module Info...</em><br /> <br /> <img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppNewModuleInfo.jpg" height="298" width="506" /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Once created, the <tt>module-info.java</tt> file will appear in the
    <em>SimpleApp</em>'s default package.&nbsp; The <tt>module</tt>
    specification will initially be empty, add the two <tt>requires</tt>
    clauses and one <tt>exports</tt> clause as depicted below.</p> 
  <p> <img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppModuleInfo1.jpg" /></p> 
  <p>With the <tt>module-info.java</tt> file properly situated and populated, the next time <em>SimpleApp</em> is built, NetBeans will add the compiled <tt>module-info.class</tt> file to contents of the <tt>SimpleApp.jar</tt> file, making it a modular jar.</p> 
  <p>It may still be a little early in the game, what appears to be missing in NetBeans at this point is the ability to construct runtime images using the JDK9 <tt>jlink</tt> utility. &nbsp;So let's do some customization to NetBeans to provide this capability. &nbsp;There are no doubt more elegant solutions, this one will enable you to output the the actual java commands that run, as they run, to aid in debugging.</p> 
  <p>The first step is to locate and edit <em>SimpleApp's</em> NetBeans <tt>project.properties</tt> file. &nbsp;You can find this file in NetBeans by clicking on the <em>Files</em> tab which gives you a filesystem view of your project. &nbsp;Underneath the <tt>nbproject/</tt> directory you'll find the <tt>project.properties</tt> file. &nbsp;Double clicking on&nbsp;<tt>project.properties</tt> will open that file for editing:</p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppProjectProperties.jpg" /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Add the following text to the end of the&nbsp;<tt>project.properties</tt> file:&nbsp;</p> 
  <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><tt>#</tt><br /><tt># Added to support creation of modular jar and jlink image.</tt><br /><tt># Change this property to match your&nbsp;</tt><tt>JDK9 location</tt><br /><tt>#</tt><br /><tt>jdk9.basedir=C:\\Users\\jtconnor\\jdk-9</tt><br /><tt>#</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.command=${jdk9.basedir}\\bin\\jar.exe</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.file=${dist.dir}\\${application.title}.jar</tt><br /><tt>#</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg1=--verbose</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg2=--update</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg3=--file</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg4=${modular.jar.file}</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg5=--main-class</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg6=${main.class}</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg7=--module-version</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg8=1.0</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg9=-C</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg10=${build.dir}\\classes</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.arg11=module-info.class</tt><br /><tt>modular.jar.args.concatenated=${modular.jar.arg1}
 ${modular.jar.arg2} ${modular.jar.arg3} ${modular.jar.arg4} 
${modular.jar.arg5} ${modular.jar.arg6} ${modular.jar.arg7} 
${modular.jar.arg8} ${modular.jar.arg9} ${modular.jar.arg10} 
${modular.jar.arg11}</tt><br /><tt>#</tt><br /><tt>jlink.command=${jdk9.basedir}\\bin\\jlink.exe</tt><br /><tt>jlink.module.dependency1=${modular.jar.file}</tt><br /><tt>jlink.module.dependency2=${jdk9.basedir}\\jmods</tt><br /><tt>jlink.module.path=${jlink.module.dependency1};${jlink.module.dependency2}</tt><br /><tt>jlink.image.dir=${dist.dir}\\jimage</tt><br /><tt>#</tt><br /><tt>jlink.arg1=--module-path</tt><br /><tt>jlink.arg2=${jlink.module.path}</tt><br /><tt>jlink.arg3=--add-modules</tt><br /><tt>jlink.arg4=${application.title}</tt><br /><tt>jlink.arg5=--output</tt><br /><tt>jlink.arg6=${jlink.image.dir}</tt><br /><tt>jlink.arg7=--compress=2</tt><br /><tt>jlink.args.concatenated=${jlink.arg1} ${jlink.arg2} ${jlink.arg3} ${jlink.arg4} ${jlink.arg5} ${jlink.arg6} ${jlink.arg7}</tt></blockquote> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><span style="font-family: &quot;&lt;span id=&quot;;"></span>It's not as bad as it looks. &nbsp;Basically most of the work here involves setting up the command line arguments for running the JDK9 <tt>jar</tt> and <tt>jlink</tt> utilities. &nbsp; And with this setup, you should be able to more easily debug the modular jar and runtime image creation should it go awry. &nbsp;The one important change that you will need to make is the setting of the <tt>jdk9.basedir</tt> property:</p> 
  <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px;"> 
    <p><tt>#</tt><br /><tt># Added to support creation of modular jar and jlink image.</tt><br /><tt># Change this property to match your&nbsp;</tt><tt>JDK9 location</tt><br /><tt>#</tt><br /><tt>jdk9.basedir=C:\\Users\\jtconnor\\jdk-9 &nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;-- Change This to point to your JDK9 location!</span></tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>With that step completed, the final modification goes to the <em>SimpleApp's</em> <tt>build.xml</tt> file. &nbsp;Just as before, this file can be found in the <em>Files</em> tab, under the <tt>SimpleApp/</tt> directory. &nbsp;Double click on <tt>build.xml</tt> to edit the file:</p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppBuildXml.jpg" /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Once the file is open, move to the end of the file. &nbsp;We are going to insert additional <em>ant</em> tasks right before <tt>&lt;/project&gt;</tt> delimiter as follows:</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> <img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppBuildXmlEdit.jpg" /></p> 
  <p>And here's the text that should be placed there:</p> 
  <pre>    &lt;target name="-post-jar" depends="-do-modular-jar,-do-jlink"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/target&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/exec&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/target&gt;
</pre> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>The <em>SimpleApp</em> project is now modified. &nbsp;Issuing a NetBeans &quot;Clean and Build&quot; on the <em>SimpleApp</em> project will now run the additional ant tasks that were incorporated into the project's <tt>build.xml</tt> file. &nbsp;Here's what the NetBeans output window should show:</p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppCleanAndBuildOutput.jpg" /><br /></p> 
  <p>Finally, let's take a look at what was built, and how the custom runtime image can be run. &nbsp;The screenshot that follows examines the <em>SimpleApp's</em> <tt>dist/</tt> directory built by NetBeans. &nbsp;It shows that there are two entries: <tt>SimpleApp.jar</tt> (the modular jar file) and a <tt>jimage/</tt> directory (the custom runtime image). &nbsp;It goes on to run <tt>java -version</tt> from the <tt>jimage/</tt> directory to show that it's a JDK9 runtime, and then issues a <tt>java --list-modules</tt> to show what modules are part of this runtime. &nbsp;Notice only three appear versus what would normally be somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 for a full-fledged JDK9 runtime. &nbsp;And to top it off, the last command shows how the <em>SimpleApp</em> application is run from the jimage/ runtime.</p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/netbeans-jlink/SimpleAppJavaDist.jpg" /> </p> 
  <p>The example shown here is specific to the Windows platform. &nbsp;If you wish to duplicate this effort on a Linux or MAC desktop, you'll need to modify the <tt>project.properties</tt> file accordingly.</p> 
  <p>Here's hoping this sheds some light on some of the new Java 9 features.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the article. Can you say anything about how large a simple self-contained (Hello World) app would be in terms of MB?. I'm particulary interested in how large the footprint gets when using latest JavaFx and packaging as a self-contained app. Thanks</p>

<p>With the jdk-9 build that was associated with blog entry above, I went through the exercise of creating a simple JavaFX program with a button, that when pressed, outputs &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the console.  This image has the following modules:</p>


<p>c:\tmp\SimpleFX\dist&gt;jimage\bin\java --list-modules<br/>
SimpleFX@1.0<br/>
java.base@9-ea<br/>
java.datatransfer@9-ea<br/>
java.desktop@9-ea<br/>
java.prefs@9-ea<br/>
java.xml@9-ea<br/>
javafx.base@9-ea<br/>
javafx.controls@9-ea<br/>
javafx.graphics@9-ea<br/>
jdk.jsobject@9-ea</p>


<p>The runtime image is 51MB.  As we are still using development pre-release builds, the size of this image may change.</p>

  <p> </p><b> </b> 
  <p> </p><b> </b> 
  <p>Applications signed with a trusted certificate come with an expiration date.&nbsp; At expiration, the code signer has to re-issue the software package with with an updated certificate in order to maintain a valid trusted signature.&nbsp; There are a whole host of reasons why re-signing may be impractical; the question becomes, is it possible to validate trusted signatures even after they have expired, thus prolonging their lifetime?&nbsp; The answer is yes by including a timestamp verified by a Timestamp Authority.&nbsp; With the timestamp, you're essentially proving that your code signing certificate was still valid at the time of signing.<br /></p> 
  <p><b> </b></p> <a name="HowToTimestamp"></a> 
  <p><font size="2"><b>How Can Code be Signed and Timestamped?</b></font></p> 
  <p>The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/jarsigner.html">jarsigner</a> utility, found in the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Development Kit</a>, is the mechanism used to for signing Java applications.&nbsp; A <tt>-tsa</tt> argument can be included on the command-line to specify a Timestamp Authority.&nbsp; A sample invocation from a Windows system might look something like this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&gt; <tt><b>jarsigner -keystore code-sign.jks <span style="color: #0003ff;">-tsa http://timestamp.comodoca.com</span> \<br />
    SocketServerFX.jar &quot;jim connors's comodo ca limited id&quot;</b><br />Enter Passphrase for keystore:<br />jar signed.</tt></p><tt> </tt> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As the code signing certificate referenced above comes from Comodo, one of many trusted certificate authorities, we use their Timestamp Authority to authorize the signature.</p> 
  <p><a name="verify"></a><font size="2"><b>How Can You Verify That a Jar File Has Been Signed?</b></font></p> 
  <p>Perhaps not the most elegant solution, you can utilize additional command-line arguments provided for by the <tt>jarsigner</tt> utility (<tt>-verify -verbose -certs</tt>) and search for a timestamp that is formatted in a specific way, as demonstrated by the following sample invocation:</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>&gt; <b>jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs SocketServerFX.jar | findstr signed</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [entry was signed on 3/1/16 8:48 AM]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [entry was signed on 3/1/16 8:48 AM]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . .<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [entry was signed on 3/1/16 8:48 AM]</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>If you see text of the form <tt>&quot;[entry was signed on ...]&quot;</tt>, then you know the jar file has been signed and timestamped.&nbsp; If the jar is not timestamped, no such output will appear.<br /></p> 
  <p><a name="netbeans"></a><font size="2"><b>How Can you Integrate Signing and Timestamping into a NetBeans Project?</b></font></p> 
  <p>Within the NetBeans IDE, if you'd like to sign and timestamp your application automatically as part of your build process, you can do so by making a few modifications to your NetBeans project.</p>

Less than a year after the introduction of the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/welcome_raspberry_pi_2">Raspberry Pi 2</a>, the Raspberry Pi foundation has once again outdone itself with yet another landmark product launch: the <i>Raspberry Pi Zero</i>.</p> 
  <p><img src="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/pizero/rpizero.jpg" /></p> 
  <p align="left"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image taken from https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/</font></p> 
  <p align="left">The Raspberry Pi Zero is truly revolutionary.&nbsp; At 40% the size of the original Pi, it consumes less than half of the power, and can be configured <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-zero-conserve-energy">to draw as little as 80mA</a>. It has a faster processor than the original (Java performance graph below), and maintains binary compatibility with previous generations.&nbsp; And with a list price of $5US, the dream of offering serious computing power to nearly anyone on the planet comes ever closer to reality.&nbsp; Here are a some of the high level features:<br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>1 GHz ARM11 Broadcom BCM2835 processor
 </li> 
    <li>512MB RAM</li> 
    <li>Micro-SD card slot</li> 
    <li>Multiple Linux distributions available plus support for Windows 10<br /></li> 
    <li>Mini-HDMI socket for 1080p video<br /></li> 
    <li>Micro-USB sockets for data and power</li> 
    <li>GPIO header (unpopulated).&nbsp; Pinout the same as Model A+/B+/2B </li> 
    <li>Composite video header (unpopulated)<br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p align="left">At the time of this article's creation (Jan 2016), availability is limited, as the first shipment sold out quite rapidly (no surprise there).&nbsp; I was able to procure my Pi Zero on the black market.&nbsp; That is to say I bought it on eBay at a substantial uplift.</p> 
  <p align="left">In terms of Java performance, the chart that follows compares SPECjvm2008 benchmark results for a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi Zero utilizing the latest available Oracle JDK (1.8.0_71).&nbsp; The larger the number, the better, the Pi Zero outperforms the original by 45%.</p> 
  <p align="left"><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/pizero/pivszero.jpg" /></p> 
  <p align="left">Another feel-good aspect to this story is that the Pi Zero will be manufactured in Wales.&nbsp; Here's hoping that in the near future supplies will meet the pent up demand.&nbsp; <br /> </p>

TITLE: Installing Trusted Certificates into a Java Keystore

BODY: 
<p>As software environments continue to ratchet up security measures, the odds of having to deal with digital certificates in more than a superficial manner only increases over time.&nbsp; Furthermore, platforms are not only mandating the use of certificates, they are to a greater extent shunning the self-signed variety and instead insisting upon certs that originate from a trusted authority.&nbsp; When managing certificates in the Java world, the utility you're most likely to encounter is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html"><tt>keytool</tt>,</a> an integral part of the Java Development Kit.&nbsp; Although <tt>keytool</tt> can be effectively used to generate self-signed private/public key pairs, it's a little lacking when it comes to incorporating in certs generated by trusted authorities.&nbsp; <i>[Based upon feedback and recommendations received after the original posting of this article, a </i><b>Postscript</b><i> section has been appended which discusses alternative solutions to the original discussed below]</i><br /></p> 
  <p>In particular, we'll focus on overcoming the following two shortcomings:<br /></p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>An existing private key and certificate generated by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) cannot be imported by <tt>keytool</tt>, at least not in the format traditionally provided by CAs.<br /></li> 
    <li>Not only must the unique private key be imported into the keystore, in some instances the root CA certificate and any intermediate certificates (referred to as a certificate chain) must be included, and more importantly <b><i>in the correct order</i></b>.&nbsp; The <tt>keytool</tt> utility doesn't help much in the way of ensuring a valid order.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>The following example uses a real SSL certificate chain from a real certificate authority and was done in the context of the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/advanced-mgmt/advancedmanagementconsole-2254207.html">Java Advanced Management Console</a> 2.1 application.&nbsp; Java AMC is a Java EE application and requires <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/overview/index-085209.html">Oracle's WebLogic</a> application server to function.&nbsp; In this instance we'll be updating a keystore associated with WebLogic, but in reality this Java keystore should be no different from any other Java keystore, so these steps should apply elsewhere just fine.</p> 
  <p>We'll leave the minutiae of applying for a trusted certificate as an exercise for the reader; one of the first steps towards getting a certificate involves creating and submitting a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) to a Certificate Authority.&nbsp; A byproduct of this process is that a private key file is generated based on the information in the CSR.&nbsp; This file, when opened, looks something like this:</p> 
  <blockquote><tt>-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----<br />encryptedgobbledygook line 1<br />...<br /> encryptedgobbledygook line n<br />-----END PRIVATE KEY-----</tt><br /></blockquote> 
  <p>This private key file is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Certificate_filename_extensions">PEM</a> (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format, and will take a <tt>.pem</tt> suffix.&nbsp; For our example, the file is stored as:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b><tt>private-key.pem</tt></b><br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For this article, we used <a href="https://www.comodo.com/">Comodo</a> (one of many alternatives) as our Certificate Authority.&nbsp; When the entire process with Comodo was complete, the following documents were ultimately received from them:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b><tt>amc-server_jtconnors_com.crt</tt></b>  - This is the Comodo-generated host-specific SSL certificate for a machine with a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of <tt>amc-server.jtconnors.com</tt><br /></li> 
    <li><b><tt>AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt</tt></b> - Comodo Root Certificate<br /></li> 
    <li><b><tt>COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt</tt></b> - Comodo Intermediate Certificate 1<br /></li> 
    <li><b><tt>COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt</tt></b> - Comodo Intermediate Certificate 2</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> 
  With these files in place we can now begin the importing process.&nbsp; We will take advantage of enhancements added to <tt>keytool</tt> with the Java 6 release: namely that <tt>keytool</tt> can merge and import keystores that are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12">PKCS12</a> format.<br /></p> 
  <p>With this new information what remains is to figure out how to convert our private key and certificate chain into a PKCS12 file.&nbsp; For this functionality we resort to the capabilities found in the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> toolkit, available on virtually all popular compute platforms.&nbsp; In the example that follows, we'll be running on a Windows system and will utilize the <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> environment to run the required OpenSSL commands.<br /><tt><tt> </tt></tt></p><tt><tt> </tt></tt> 
  <blockquote> </blockquote> 
  <p>Step 1. (From Cygwin) Concatenate the certificates comprising the CA-supplied root certificate chain to one file.&nbsp; Include only the root certificate and intermediate certificate(s) and exclude the host-specific SSL certificate.</p> 
  <blockquote> </blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><tt>$ cat AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt &gt; BUNDLE.crt</tt></b></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote> </blockquote> 
  <p>Step 2. (From Cygwin) Create a PKCS12 keystore.&nbsp; This command incorporates both the certificate chain along with the SSL private key and certificates.&nbsp; Your passwords may vary.<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> </blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><tt>$ openssl pkcs12 -export -chain -in amc-server_jtconnors_com.crt -inkey private-key.pem -out keystore.p12 -name amc-server -CAfile BUNDLE.crt<br />Enter Export Password: </tt></b><tt>changeit</tt><b><tt><br />Verifying - Enter Export Password: </tt></b><tt>changeit</tt><br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Step 3. (From Windows CMD) Using <tt>keytool</tt>, import the PKCS12 keystore into the resulting JKS keystore called <tt>keystore.jks</tt>. Again, you may select different passwords.<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><tt>&gt; &quot;c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_66\bin\keytool.exe&quot; -importkeystore -destkeystore keystore.jks -srckeystore keystore.p12 -alias amc-server<br />Enter destination keystore password: </tt></b><tt>changeit</tt><b><tt><br />Re-enter new password: </tt></b><tt>changeit</tt><b><tt><br />Enter source keystore password: </tt></b><tt>changeit</tt><br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Step 4. With the keystore successfully created we can now take the optional step of further verifying it.&nbsp; Certain Java-based application frameworks, like Oracle's WebLogic for example, can be finicky about the completeness and order of the certificate chain.&nbsp; To help validate the keystore, we can use the <tt>ValidateCertChain</tt> program which comes bundled with WebLogic 12c and can be found in the distribution's <tt>weblogic.jar</tt> file.&nbsp; Here's a sample invocation of the program on our recently created <tt>keystore.jks</tt> file:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><tt>&gt; java -cp %MW_HOME%\wlserver\server\lib\weblogic.jar utils.ValidateCertChain -jks amc-server keystore.jks<br />Cert[0]: CN=amc-server.jtconnors.com,OU=PositiveSSL,OU=Domain Control Validated<br />Cert[1]: CN=COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA,O=COMODO CA Limited,L=Salford,ST=Greater Manchester,C=GB<br />Cert[2]: CN=COMODO RSA Certification Authority,O=COMODO CA Limited,L=Salford,ST=Greater Manchester,C=GB<br />Cert[3]: CN=AddTrust External CA Root,OU=AddTrust External TTP Network,O=AddTrust AB,C=SE<br />Certificate chain appears valid</tt></b></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Here's hoping these examples save you some time, and more importantly, a little grief.<br /></p> 
  <p><b>Postscript</b></p> 
  <p>After having received recommendations from the engineers far better versed in AMC and WebLogic, the following section was added to briefly discuss alternatives to the above mentioned OpenSSL solution.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><b>Alternative A</b>:&nbsp; For people that have complete control of the certificate generating process, they can, as previously hinted, use <tt>keytool</tt> exclusively for this process. For the first phase of the process they can use <tt>keytool</tt> in the following general manner (arguments to <tt>keytool</tt> will vary) to generate a keypair and certificate request:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><tt>keytool -keystore keystore.jks -genkeypair -keyalg rsa
<br />keytool -keystore keystore.jks -certreq</tt></b> </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In this scenario, OpenSSL would not be required since the keypair is already stored in the keystore.&nbsp; From here you can import the certificates following a form similar to this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><tt>keytool -import -keystore keystore.jks -alias root -file AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt
<br />
keytool -import -keystore keystore.jks -alias intermediate1 -file COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt
<br />
keytool -import -keystore keystore.jks -alias intermediate2 -file COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt
<br />
keytool -import -keystore keystore.jks -alias mykey -file amc-server_jtconnors_com.crt</tt></b></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In the last command, &quot;<tt>-alias mykey</tt>&quot; is essential and must match the key pair in the keystone.&nbsp; As a shortcut, you could also concatenate all PEM-encoded certificates into a big file and then call:
</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><tt>keytool -import -keystore keystore.jks -alias mykey -file thebigfile</tt></b> </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Alternative B</b>: Along with the <tt>ValidateChain</tt> program WebLogic 12c's <tt>weblogic.jar</tt> file also includes a utility called <tt>ImportPrivateKey</tt> which can also used to import a certificate chain into a Java keystore.&nbsp; This utility
      command is
      described in <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/wls/SECMG/identity_trust.htm#SECMG791">Creating
        a Keystore Using ImportPrivateKey</a> subsection of WebLogic
      documention on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/wls/SECMG/identity_trust.htm">Configuring
        Keystores</a>.&nbsp; The command follows a form like this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre style="font-family: Consolas,monospace; font-size: inherit; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b><tt>java -cp %WL_HOME%\server\lib\weblogic.jar utils.ImportPrivateKey -keystore <i>newkeystore</i> -storepass <i>**keystorepassword** </i> -alias <i>amctrust</i> -certfile <i>certificate.pem </i> -keyfile <i>privatekey.pem</i> [-keyfilepass <i>**privatekeypassword**</i>]</tt></b></pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>For further edification please consult the WebLogic docs.<br /></p> 
  <p> </p>

<p>You may need to add &quot; -srcstoretype PKCS12&quot; to the keytool command for importing the keystore : </p>


<p>&gt; &quot;c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_66\bin\keytool.exe&quot; -importkeystore -destkeystore keystore.jks -srckeystore keystore.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -alias amc-server</p>


<p>I needed it to resolve an &quot;Invalid keystore format&quot; issue.<br/>
Other than that, the procedure (the original one, I didn't try the alternatives) worked brilliantly for me.</p>

<p>using original solution didn't worked for me. After 'cat' of files for the second command I got this error below, that I could not figure out how to fix.</p>


<p>139852180010824:error:0B07F069:x509 certificate routines:X509_verify_cert:no cert set for us to verify:x509_vfy.c:164:   </p>


<p>I also tried many different commands and options, but thanks for the Alternate A, it worked and saved me a lot of hours.  </p>

<p>
Like it's big brother <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java SE</a>, the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/embedded-se/downloads/index.html">Java SE-Embedded 8</a> platform provides support for <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html">Java Flight Recorder</a>, an invaluable profiling and event collection framework built into the Java Runtime Environment.&nbsp; However, Flight Recorder is only available with the Java SE Embedded 8 <i>Full JRE</i>, not with the smaller <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/resources/tech/compact-profiles-overview-2157132.html">Compact Profiles</a>.&nbsp; So the question becomes, is there anything that can be done to use Java Flight Recorder with Compact Profiles?</p> 
  <p>At the current time, the smaller Compact1 and Compact2 profiles cannot realistically support Java Flight Recorder without substantial changes.&nbsp; Hence we'll avoid discussing their prospects for inclusion here.&nbsp; What we will focus on is Compact3 as <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161">its specification</a> includes among others, the <tt>javax.management</tt> APIs, making for a more reasonable match.&nbsp; As it turns out, all that is required to enable Flight Recorder use with the Compact3 profile is to copy over a few files over from the Full JRE.&nbsp; The instructions that follow should aid in creating a Flight Recorder enabled instance:<br /> </p> 
  <p>1. Download a Java SE-Embedded EJRE for your platform.&nbsp; You can do so <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/embedded-se/downloads/index.html">here</a>.&nbsp; For this example, we'll do this on a Linux host and choose the ARMv6/v7 Hard Float option (suitable for the venerable Raspberry Pi).</p> 
  <p>2. Extract the EJRE.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ tar xvf ejdk-8u51-linux-armv6-vfp-hflt.tar.gz</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>3. Use the EJRE's <tt>jrecreate.sh</tt> script to create a full JRE:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ ./ejdk1.8.0_51/bin/jrecreate.sh --dest full_jre -g -k<br />Building JRE using Options {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ejdk-home: /home/pi/ejdk1.8.0_51<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dest: /home/pi/full_jre<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; target: linux_armv6_vfp_hflt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vm: all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; runtime: jre<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debug: true<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep-debug-info: true<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no-compression: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dry-run: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verbose: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extension: []<br />}<br /><br /><br />Target JRE Size is 59,389 KB (on disk usage may be greater).<br />Embedded JRE created successfully</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>4. Create a Compact3 JRE:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ ./ejdk1.8.0_51/bin/jrecreate.sh --profile compact3 --dest compact3 -g -k<br />Building JRE using Options {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ejdk-home: /home/pi/ejdk1.8.0_51<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dest: /home/pi/compact3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; target: linux_armv6_vfp_hflt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vm: client<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; runtime: compact3 profile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debug: true<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep-debug-info: true<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no-compression: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dry-run: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verbose: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extension: []<br />}<br /><br /><br />Target JRE Size is 24,336 KB (on disk usage may be greater).<br />Embedded JRE created successfully</tt> <br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>5.&nbsp; Check the size of the compact3 JRE.&nbsp; We'll use this to see how much space was needed to add support for Flight Recorder.<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ du -sk compact3<br />24480&nbsp;&nbsp; compact3</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>6.&nbsp; Create the <tt>compact3/lib/jfr/</tt> directory</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ mkdir compact3/lib/jfr</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>7.&nbsp; Copy the following files over from the full JRE to the <tt>compact3</tt> instance with these commands:</p> 
  <blockquote> <tt>$ cd full_jre/<br />
    $ cp ./lib/jfr.jar ../compact3/lib<br />
    $ cp ./lib/arm/libjfr.so ../compact3/lib/arm<br />
    $ cp ./lib/arm/libbci.so ../compact3/lib/arm<br /> $ cp ./lib/jfr/default.jfc ../compact3/lib/jfr<br />
    $ cp ./lib/jfr/profile.jfc ../compact3/lib/jfr</tt> </blockquote> 
  <p>8. That's all that is required.&nbsp; You can compare the disk usage of the compact3/ directory before and after these modifications to get an idea of the additional space required to utilize Java Flight Recorder. </p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ du -sk ../compact3<br />24824&nbsp;&nbsp; ../compact3</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>So comparing the disk usage of step (5), we see that less than 400KB is added in order to enable usage of Java Flight Recorder. To better understand how you might remotely connect to a Flight Recorder enabled instance in a secure fashion, check out <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/managing_java_flight_recorder_enabled">this article</a>.<br /></p>

<p>A sampling of indices gauging computer programming language popularity (e.g. <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">PYPL</a> and <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIBOE</a>) shows that Java, after 20 years, still enjoys a huge following.&nbsp; In general, depending upon whom and/or when you ask, Java usually comes in first or second place in these surveys.&nbsp; Although it might be hard to imagine recent computer science graduates without Java exposure, one trend is evident: top universities are gravitating towards teaching &quot;simpler&quot; languages in lieu of Java for their introductory programming classes.</p> 
  <p><img width="472" height="302" src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/jshell/pypl.jpg" /> </p> 
  <p>The standard Java platform, compared to its counterparts like Python, currently lacks a <i>Read-Eval-Print-Loop</i> otherwise known as a <i>REPL</i>.&nbsp; Instead of having to construct and compile complete syntactically correct programs before feedback can be achieved, REPLs allow much more interactivity, enabling the student/programmer to enter small snippets of code and receive immediate feedback.&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/222">Java Enhancement Proposal</a> which outlines the new jshell functionality, &quot;The number one reason schools cite for moving away from Java as a

bars to an initial <code class="prettyprint">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> program.&quot;&nbsp; With the introduction of jshell in the upcoming Java 9 release, this shortcoming will be eliminated.</p> 
  <p>Falling under the auspices of an OpenJDK project called <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/">Kulla</a>, the code representing the REPL capability has yet to be incorporated into the core <a href="https://jdk9.java.net/download/">JDK 9 early access release</a>.&nbsp; As of the writing of this article (late July 2015), a separate build is required to get the jshell functionality.&nbsp; In the (hopefully not-too-distant) future an early access release will bundle all these features together obviating the need for extra work.&nbsp; In the interim, here's a brief video demonstrating some of it's features.<br /> </p>

  <p>As we near the &quot;feature complete&quot; phase for JDK 9, we look forward to better integration and incorporation of yet more new important features into this upcoming release.</p>

<p>jShell providing REPL capabilities are cool, but what if with any java version (1.5+) you could attach something that provides jShell capabilities and more to a running JVM? This is one the things javosize does. What do you think?</p>

<p>
Recently, a reader commented on a dated article of mine, circa 2010, entitled <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/javafx_sockets_and_threading_lessons">JavaFX, Sockets and Threading: Lessons Learned</a>.&nbsp; In it he correctly stated that, as the original content is based on the deprecated JavaFX 1.3 framework (aka JavaFX Script), he cannot test or utilize that code with the modern JavaFX API.&nbsp; What follows is an update to that blog entry with code and references appropriate for the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm">JavaFX 8 (Java SE 8 with JavaFX) platform</a>.</p> 
  <p><b>Overview</b></p> 
  <p>For a more thorough understanding of the method behind this madness, please consult the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/javafx_sockets_and_threading_lessons">original article</a>.&nbsp; Briefly stated, socket programming, especially in Java, often times lends itself to utilizing threads.&nbsp; To facilitate using sockets, both from the &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; side, an abstract class called <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/GenericSocket.java">GenericSocket.java</a> was and is provided and, baring a few minor changes, remains quite similar to the original version. Just as in the Original JavaFX Script framework, <i><b>The JavaFX UI is still not thread-safe and its scene graph must only be accessed through the JavaFX application thread</b></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; What has changed between old and new is the class and method name required to perform work on the JavaFX application thread.</p> 
  <p>Just like before, we've identified two methods associated with socket manipulations that need to perform work on the main thread.&nbsp; These abstract method calls are incorporated into the GenericSocket.java source and are specified in the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/SocketListener.java">SocketListener.java</a> interface file:</p> 
  <pre>    public interface SocketListener {
        public void onMessage(String line);
        public void onClosedStatus(boolean isClosed);
    }</pre> 
  <p>Within <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/GenericSocket.java">GenericSocket.java</a>, you'll see references to these method calls as follows:</p> 
  <pre>    /*
     * The onClosedStatus() method has to be implemented by
     * a sublclass.  If used in conjunction with JavaFX,
     * use Platform.runLater() to force this method to run
     * on the main thread.
     */
     onClosedStatus(true);</pre> 
  <p>&nbsp;and</p> 
  <pre>    /*
     * The onMessage() method has to be implemented by
     * a sublclass.  If used in conjunction with JavaFX,
     * use Platform.runLater() to force this method to run
     * on the main thread.
     */
     onMessage(line);</pre> 
  <p>As implied by these comments, JavaFX-specifc classes that extend the <tt>GenericSocket</tt> class and implement the <tt>SocketListener</tt> interface are required.&nbsp; Correspondingly two helper classes have been created: <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/FxSocketClient.java">FxSocketClient.java</a> and <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/FxSocketServer.java">FxSocketServer.java</a>.&nbsp; These extend the <tt>GenericSocket</tt> class and implement the <tt>SocketListener</tt> interface from the perspective of a JavaFX environment.&nbsp; Both classes override the <tt>onMessage()</tt> method like this:</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> <img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/onMessage.jpg" /><br /></p> 
  <p>Likewise, the <tt>onClosedStatus()</tt> method is implemented as follows:</p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/onClosedStatus.png" /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>As these two code snippets exhibit, we enclose our execution requirements within a call to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/application/Platform.html#runLater%28java.lang.Runnable%29"><tt>Platform.runLater()</tt></a> method, ensuring that&nbsp; it will be executed on the JavaFX application thread.&nbsp; (For the Java 8 aficionados, you may notice that these two methods could be converted to lambda expressions. That exercise is left to the reader.)&nbsp; What remains now is for any referencing JavaFX class to implement the <tt>SocketListener</tt> interface.<br /></p> 
  <p>To demonstrate the usage of <tt>FxSocketClient</tt> and <tt>FxSocketServer</tt> classes within JavaFX 8, this article provides two NetBeans projects represented by the screenshot that follows.</p> 
  <p><img width="623" height="218" src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/SocketClient-ServerFX.png" /></p> 
  <p>The user interface for these programs was created with the assistance of a terrific tool called the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-info-2157684.html">JavaFX Scene Builder</a>.&nbsp; You can download the source code, including the UI (represented in FXML), here:</p> 
  <ul>

    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/socket_FX8/SocketServerFX.zip">SocketServerFX.zip</a></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><b>The <tt>javafx.concurrent</tt> Package</b></p> 
  <p>The intent of this article was to focus solely on the <tt>Platform.runLater()</tt> method, however, it is important to note that JavaFX 2.x also provides an additional means to create background tasks that safely interact with the JavaFX application thread.&nbsp; Similar in capability to the venerable <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html"><tt>java.util.concurrent</tt></a>&nbsp; package (and in fact extending some of those classes), the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/concurrent/package-summary.html"><tt>javafx.concurrent</tt></a> package also furnishes the ability to safely control the execution
and track the progress of the application code running in background tasks. For an overview of their use, check out the following article published as part of the Oracle documentation: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/threads/jfxpub-threads.htm">Concurrency in Java FX</a>.<br /></p>

<p>Jim,<br/>
This is a great tutorial.  However, I am having problems with re-opening the socket server when it is shut down in auto connect mode.  I think that the thread is not getting stopped properly.</p>


<p>Here is what I do to reproduce the problem.<br/>
Bring up the SocketClientFX application - Okay<br/>
Bring up the SocketServerFX appliation - Okay<br/>
On the SocketServer application, click on the button to Auto Connect - Okay<br/>
On the SocketClient Application, click on the Connect button; Connection made - Okay<br/>
On the SocketClient Application, write a message, and send it; Message sent - Okay<br/>
On the SocketClient Application, click on Disconnect - Okay<br/>
On the SocketServer application, exit the application - Okay<br/>
Bring the SocketServer Application back up - Okay<br/>
Click on the Connect or Auto-Connect button - Not Okay</p>


<p>I think that the socket thread is still running from the previous running of the SocketServer application, and it won't connect.</p>


<p>Do you know how to properly shut down the thread so that if it is in auto-connect, it won't leave the thread going?</p>


<p>Thanks,<br/>
Wayne</p>

<p>Hi Wayne,</p>


<p>Thanks so much for your comment, you are correct.  There is a shutdown() method that can be called to close the SocketServer's socket but it looks like the application never gets signaled to do so because the SocketServer is in a separate thread.</p>


<p>1. A quick and dirty solution would be to detect when the JavaFX application is terminated (when the user clicks on the red &quot;x&quot;) and simply exit.  To add slightly more elegance, a shutdownHook can be added whose method gets called at program exit.  From within that method, we could call the SocketServer's shutdown() method if the socket is open.</p>


<p>2. Another solution would be to include an &quot;exit&quot; button that would shut the program down more gracefully.</p>


<p>I'll work on the quick and dirty fix</p>


<p>-- Jim C</p>

<p>Hi Eduardo,</p>


<p>The sample code shown here cannot accommodate multiple socket readers.</p>


<p>It's been quite a while but in the blog entry, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/source_code_for_javafx_scoreboard" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/source_code_for_javafx_scoreboard</a> I made the source code available for a scoreboard application which uses, somewhere in its bowels, a server capable of handling multiple sockets.  Check out the blog entry, and if you do download the source look for the MultipleSocketWriter.java and FxMultipleSocketWriter.java files for some hints.</p>

<p>Hey Jim,</p>


<p>Thanks for this updated tutorial. Most of that was out of my league, but still I njoyed reading it. Although I'm having a project based on Swings which is on basis of P2P, so just thinking of migrating it to JavaFX. Although I'm reusing the code from swing model, is there anything prior to old codes, that I shud consider knowing very much that can help me in smoothing the porting process.!</p>

<p>Hello Akki,</p>


<p>There's a fair amount of literature aimed at developers looking to migrate from Swing to JavaFX.  You might want to start with  the Oracle tutorial called:</p>

<p>You could use the binary-to-text encoding technique.  When sending binary data, you encode (convert) it into printable characters, and on the remote side you decode it to its original form.  One of the popular encoding standards in is Base64.  The Java 8 encode/decode API is here:</p>

<p>
Having <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-sales-edge-towards-four-million/">surpassed 4 million units shipped</a> and clearly establishing itself as a de facto reference platform, the folks at the Raspberry Pi Foundation are not resting on their laurels.&nbsp; Earlier this month (February 2015), they introduced the <em><strong><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 2 Model B</a></strong></em>:<br /></p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/pi2/pi2.jpg" /> 
  <p>Compared to its predecessor, the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/">Raspberry Pi B+</a>, this newer model is packaged with a Broadcom BCM2836 SoC at 900MHz.&nbsp; It is not only superior in performance to the original single core BCM2835 processor on core-by-core basis, it now brings the added benefit of including 4 cores.&nbsp; Add to that a doubling of RAM from 512MB to 1GB and it should be no mystery that this new platform can handle more serious workloads.&nbsp; <a href="#perf">Later on down, a chart compares the SPECjvm2008 benchmark performance</a> of the original Raspberry Pi Model B with the new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.</p> 
  <p>In addition to the substantial performance bump, major kudos are to be given to the Raspberry Pi Foundation engineers for their focus on hardware and software compatibility:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The Pi2 maintains the same physical form factor as the Raspberry Pi B+, meaning that all of the previous accessories (USB power cable, serial console cable, microSD card ...) all work perfectly well with the new version.&nbsp; That also includes any Raspberry Pi B+ enclosures you may have too.</li> 
    <li>The ARMv7-based BCM2836 processor is backwards-compatible with the original ARMv6 version.&nbsp; In order to maintain binary compatibility, the latest version of the <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian distribution</a> will boot either the new or old versions of the Raspberry Pi.&nbsp; Note that in this mode, applications will not be able to take full advantage of the ARMv7 enhancements.&nbsp; Alternate OS distributions may provide the extra performance boost at the expense of breaking backwards compatibility.</li> 
    <li>Perhaps best of all, the Raspberry Pi maintains its appeal to the masses.&nbsp; At approximately £23/$35, no price increase comes along with this upgrade.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><a name="perf"></a><strong>A Brief Look at  Performance</strong></p> 
  <p>The chart that follows examines Raspberry Pi Java performance via the <a href="https://www.spec.org/jvm2008/">SPECjvm2008</a> benchmark.&nbsp; Both original and Raspberry Pi 2 systems ran the latest available Raspbian Image (2015-02-02) and the latest available Java 7 JDK (Java 7 update 72)<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; The four vertical bars (blue, red, green, purple) represent four separate runs of the benchmark:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">Blue</span></strong>: <em>Raspberry Pi Model B</em>.&nbsp; Invoked with JVM argument <tt>-Xmx400m</tt> specifying a maximum heap of 400MB.</li> 
    <li><strong><span style="color: #c0504d;">Red</span></strong>: <em>Raspberry Pi 2, single threaded</em>.&nbsp; Invoked with JVM argument <tt>-Xmx400m </tt>specifying a maximum heap of 400MB, and application argument <tt>-bt 1</tt> instructing the SPECjvm2008 test harness to run the benchmark tests with a single thread.&nbsp; This is meant to approximate an apples-to-apples comparison of single core performance between the two Raspberry Pi systems.<br /></li> 
    <li><strong><span style="color: #9bbb59;">Green</span></strong>: <em>Raspberry Pi 2, multithreaded (default)</em>.&nbsp; Invoked with JVM argument <tt>-Xmx600m</tt> specifying a maximum heap of 600MB<sup>2</sup>.</li> 
    <li><strong><span style="color: #8064a2;">Purple</span></strong>: <em>Raspberry Pi 2, multithreaded (default), larger heap</em>.&nbsp;  Invoked with JVM argument <tt>-Xmx900m</tt> specifying a maximum heap of 900MB<sup>3</sup>.<br /></li> 
  </ol> 
  <ul> </ul> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/pi2/SPECjvm2008-composite.jpg" /><br /></p> 
  <p>The larger the measurement (ops/min), the faster the result, the single core performance of the Raspberry Pi 2 is a big improvement over its predecessor.&nbsp; As the SPECjvm2008 suite does include a healthy dose of mutithreaded code, enabling the test harness to take advantage of the 4 hardware threads available to the Pi 2 added another huge jump in performance.&nbsp; And finally utilizing the extra RAM (in the form of a larger heap) provided for by the Raspberry Pi 2 yields only a very modest gain in throughput.&nbsp; In particular, 2 of the 11 component tests (compress, xml) show an improvement with the extra heap.&nbsp; For more detailed results, you can view this <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/pi2/SPECjvm2008-results.xlsx">spreadsheet</a>.</p> 
  <p>The added horsepower that the Raspberry Pi 2 brings solidifies the Raspberry Pi family as an important reference platform in the present as well as the future for companies like Oracle.&nbsp; As the Internet of Things phenomena plays out and more processing is brought to the edge, the new Raspberry Pi is better suited to handle the increased workload that applications like <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/embedded/event-processing/overview/index.html">Oracle Event Processing for Oracle Java Embedded</a> and others require. <br /></p> 
  <p><strong>Notes</strong></p> 
  <p><sup>1</sup> The latest Raspbian distro includes a recent version of Oracle's Java 8 JDK.&nbsp; Unfortunately 
the somewhat dated SPECjvm2008 benchmark has a dependency that requires 
Java 1.7 or earlier, so for these benchmarks, we needed to use a Java 7 
JDK.&nbsp; The latest available, 7u72, was used for these tests.<br /></p> 
  <p><sup>2</sup> With 4 cores, the SPECjvm2008 test suite would produce an <tt>OutOfMemoryError</tt> when run with the initial max heap size argument of <tt>-Xmx400m</tt>.&nbsp; Increasing the max heap size to 600MB (<tt>-Xmx600m</tt>) enabled the tests to complete.&nbsp; Evidently SPECjvm2008 requires more heap space as more hardware threads are configured in.<br /></p> 
  <p><sup>3</sup> In order to utilize the full amount of RAM (1GB) available with the Raspberry Pi 2, a firmware upgrade may be required.&nbsp; If necessary, you can invoke '<tt>sudo rpi-update</tt>'&nbsp; from a linux shell on the Raspberry Pi 2 to accomplish this task.<br /></p>

<p> One advantage <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html">Java Flight Recorder</a> enjoys is that its event collection and profiling framework is built right into the JDK, allowing instrumented JVM instances to operate with near-zero overhead.&nbsp; At arguably negligible expense, would it then make sense to consider enabling Java Flight Recorder on production applications?&nbsp; We say absolutely!</p> 
  <p>You can google around to search for how this framework can be configured to monitor remote JVMs, and nearly all of the reference material will help you get up to speed quickly.&nbsp; However, you'll find that these examples favor simplicity over security.&nbsp; They generally disable authentication and encryption leaving the remote application vulnerable to anyone who knows or can guess its host name and port number.&nbsp; In the real world, if you wanted to monitor a production application remotely, you'd need to carefully consider the security ramifications.</p> 
  <p>Not finding much in the way of instruction here, we thought it might be helpful to document, by example, how a sample remote Java application can be more securely instrumented and managed with Java Flight Recorder and Java Mission Control.&nbsp; What follows are the steps necessary to enable monitoring over a connection that is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</p> 
  <p>For the remainder of this article, we'll refer to the instrumented JVM as the <b><i>remote</i></b> side of the solution<i><b>.</b></i>&nbsp; To demonstrate the ubiquity of the Java SE platform, our remote JVM will actually reside on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.&nbsp; As Java SE and Java SE Embedded runtime environments both now bundle the Java Flight Recorder feature set, it doesn't really matter what type of remote JVM instance we have.&nbsp; The location where the Java Mission Control application runs will be referred to as the <i><b>client</b></i> side.&nbsp; For this example we'll use an Ubuntu-based system.&nbsp; In reality, the client could have run on any of the alternative supported Java clients like Windows or MacOS.<br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><b>On the <i>remote</i> side (hostname pi1): </b><br /></p> 
  <p>Remote side, step 0: Create a directory to house the signed digital certificates required for SSL communication.&nbsp; Moreover, it should have minimal access.<br /></p> 
  <blockquote><tt>pi1$ <b>mkdir $HOME/.certs</b><br />pi1$ <b>chmod 700 $HOME/.certs</b></tt><br /></blockquote> 
  <p> </p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> </p>

  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote> </blockquote> 
  <p>On the client side, Java Mission Control is started in the following way:</p>

<p>This is a great article, if you run Linux and/or use a Pi. <br/>
How would the process look if one was using Windows as the OS on both ends?</p>

<p>A couple of things here Marty:</p>


<p>1. The example that is used in this article would not be possible if both ends were Windows because Java SE Embedded is not available for the Raspberry Pi on Windows -- only for Linux.</p>


<p>2. If the remote platform were a Windows desktop or server, then a very similar proccess to what is described above can be used.  The most important utility required to accomplish Flight Recorder with SSL is keytool.  It works exactly the same on both Linux and Windows.  What would have to change in the examples would be the location of the files in question and the directory separators (&quot;/&quot; versus &quot;\&quot;).  Addtionally there are some Linux specific commands in the article (e.g. mkdir $HOME/.certs, chmod 700 $HOME/.certs ...) that would need a suitable Windows replacement if relevant.</p>

<p>Looking back, creating the the jmcTrustStore on the remote side looks unnecessary, however you still need to create the client side jmcKeyStore.  It's been three years since writing this article, I just tried this recipe without creating the jmcTrustStore and it worked.  My guess is there's some discrepancy in your runtime options for either/or starting the remote jfr application or the jmc client.</p>

<p>For standalone application, we need add jmcTrustStore as truststore while starting application else ssl handshake is not successful.</p>


<p>(See <a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/monitor-java-with-jmx" rel="nofollow">https://www.lullabot.com/articles/monitor-java-with-jmx</a> for keystore i used. Instead of jconsole i have used jmc). In my use case both application and jmc are on same box, but the logic is still valid.</p>


<p>For my windows program I used the following on application side:<br/>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true <br/>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3614 <br/>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true<br/>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=&quot;c:\jmx\jmxremote.password&quot; <br/>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=&quot;c:\jmx\jmxremote.access&quot;<br/>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=true<br/>
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=C:\keytool\tomcat.jks<br/>
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=&lt;password&gt;<br/>
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\keytool\tomcattruststore.jks<br/>
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=&lt;password&gt;<br/>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.need.client.auth=true<br/>
-Djavax.net.debug=ssl</p>


<p>For client side i used the following:<br/>
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_111\bin\jmc.exe&quot; -vmargs -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\keytool\jmctruststore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=&lt;password&gt;<br/>
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=c:\keytool\jmc.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=&lt;password&gt;<br/>
-Djavax.net.debug=ssl </p>

BODY: 
<p> One of the challenges in creating the content for the <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2097">Java One 2014 Java SE Embedded Internet of Things Hands-on-Lab</a> concerned interacting, via Java and OSGi, with a USB temperature sensor. &nbsp; Unfortunately a USB communications API is not part of the Java SE standard (as of this post: Halloween 2014).&nbsp; So the question is, how can Java/USB communication be established, and furthermore and how does this work within the OSGi framework?<br /><br /></p> 
  <p><img width="247" height="156" src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/setup.jpg" /> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>In looking around at some of the available options, we chose the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/">javahidapi</a> as the basis for this connectivity.&nbsp; As a Java/JNI wrapper around the <a href="http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/">C/C++ HID API for Linux, MacOS X and Windows</a>, the appeal behind this API is that using it does not require the
use of a custom driver for each device on each platform.</p> 
  <p>In order to operate within an OSGi framework (in this case Apache Felix 4.4), javahidapi's open source code has been slightly modified/enhanced. The end result is that an OSGi bundle is available that can be dropped into standard OSGi frameworks to support USB communication for HID devices.&nbsp; It does contain a native component, and for the sake of simplicity, we've decided to include a separate jar file for each supported architecture.&nbsp; For the OSGi enthusiast, here's what the generated <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file looks like for the Linux/armhf (suitable for the Raspberry Pi) architecture: </p> 
  <p><tt>Manifest-Version: 1.0<br />Bnd-LastModified: 1415889978962<br />Build-Jdk: 1.7.0_51<br />Built-By: jtconnor<br />Bundle-Activator: com.codeminders.hidapi.Activator<br />Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2<br />Bundle-Name: hidapi OSGi Bundle for Linux/armhf<br />Bundle-NativeCode: native/linux/armv6l/libhidapi-jni-32.so; osname=Linux; processor=armv6l<br />Bundle-SymbolicName: com.codeminders.hidapi-armhf<br />Bundle-Version: 1.0.0<br />Created-By: Apache Maven Bundle Plugin<br />Export-Package: com.codeminders.hidapi;uses:=&quot;org.osgi.framework&quot;;version=&quot;1.0.0&quot;<br />Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version=&quot;[1.6,2)&quot;<br />Tool: Bnd-1.50.0</tt></p> 
  <p>Here are some pre-built hidapi OSGi bundles for popular Linux platforms:</p>

  </ul> 
  <p>To get a feel for the changes made to the original source, here's what was done:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>A NetBeans project was created under the Maven-&gt;OSGi Bundle category</li> 
    <li>The Java source code for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/">javahidapi</a> was placed in the project's <tt>src/main/java/com/codeminders/hidapi</tt> directory<br /></li> 
    <li>The architecture specific native library was placed in the project's <tt>src/main/resources/native/linux/<i><b>architecture</b></i></tt> directory.&nbsp; For example, the Linux/x86 version of the project places the <tt>libhidapi-jni-32.so</tt> file in the <tt>src/main/resources/native/linux/x86</tt> directory.</li> 
    <li>An <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/Activator.java"><tt>Activator.java</tt></a> class was added in the project's <tt>src/main/java/com/codeminders/hidapi</tt> directory.&nbsp; In OSGi, the <tt>start()</tt> method in this class gets called when this bundle is activated.&nbsp; It is specified in the bundle's <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file.</li> 
    <li>The original <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/ClassPathLibraryLoader.java">ClassPathLibraryLoader.java</a> file was simplified and is currently only appropriate for Linux deployments.<br /></li> 
    <li>As this is a Maven-based project, the project's <tt>pom.xml</tt> file was edited (<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/pom.xml">here's what the x86 version looks like</a>), such that at build time it will generate a <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file similar to the one referenced above.<br /></li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>And here are the associated NetBeans Projects which can be used to build the 4 bundles referenced above.</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/hidapi_armhf.zip">hidapi_armhf</a></li> 
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/hidapi_armv5tel.zip">hidapi_armv5tel</a></li> 
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/hidapi_x86.zip">hidapi_x86</a></li> 
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/hidapi_x86_64.zip">hidapi_x86_64</a></li> 
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/Java_USB/hidapi_quark.zip">hidapi_quark</a> <br /></li> 
  </ul>If you'd like to extend this template to include OSGi bundles for additional architectures, you can start with one of the projects above, clone it, and make the appropriate changes for your new environment.&nbsp; If the native javahidapi component for your new platform is not available, you'll have to <a href="https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/downloads">pull down the source for hidapi</a> and build it for inclusion into your project.&nbsp; If anyone is interested in going through this exercise, I'd be glad to post the fruits of their labor here.<br />

<p>Got my hands on an Intel Galileo board, based on the Intel Quark processor.  This uses the x86 instruction set, but may not support all of the recent x86 instructions.  The 32-bit x86 version of the hidapi bundle on the Galileo board was seg faulting, so I compiled the hidapi native component on the Galileo board and provided another bundle specific to the Linux/quark platform.  The quark specific packaged solved the problems.</p>


<p>This blog has been updated to include the quark bundle and NetBeans project.</p>

TITLE: Java Serial Communications Revisited
DATE: 06/20/2014 19:10:52
PRIMARY CATEGORY: Sun
STATUS: publish
ALLOW COMMENTS: 1

BODY: 
<p>
Last touched upon in <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/serial_port_communication_for_java">this article</a> dated August 2011, it's high time to revisit the state of Java serial port communications options for the following reasons:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>As the hype around Internet of Things continues to ratchet up, serial communications are a requirement for a certain class of IoT sensors and devices.</li> 
    <li>RxTx, the platform with arguably the most history, cannot be built with the recently released Java 8 JDK without some modifications.</li> 
    <li>For some time now the website hosting the RxTx project: <a href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a> has not been available.<br /></li> 
    <li>Building support for additional specifications like RS-485 and parallel is available in RxTx but was never addressed in the previous serial communications article.<br /></li> 
    <li>An alternative framework called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/">jSSC</a> is gaining in popularity and is worth further discussion.</li> 
    <li>Work in the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/dio/">OpenJDK Device I/O Project</a> is progressing. Among the goals of this project is support for serial communications.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><b>RxTx</b></p> 
  <p>In my customer experiences, RxTx, despite its age, still gets mentioned most when considering serial communications with Java.&nbsp; For whatever reasons, the RxTx project has gone off line, and access to the project source code is not readily available.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have a copy, and have made a few enhancements such that:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The source can now be compiled with a JDK versions 6, 7 and 8.</li> 
    <li>The <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/serial_port_communication_for_java">original article</a> discussed only enough modifications to build the&nbsp; <tt>librxtxSerial.so</tt> shared object required for traditional serial communications.&nbsp; The <tt>librxtxParallel.so</tt>, <tt>librxtxRaw.so</tt>, <tt>librxtxI2C.so</tt> and <tt>librxtxRS485.so</tt> shared objects could not be built.&nbsp; With some very slight modifications, these can successfully be built too.&nbsp; I make absolutely no promises as to their usefulness, but they do compile. :)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The source code is based upon the original 2.1-7r2 version and in this instance is now called <b><tt>2.1.7r2-Java8</tt></b>.&nbsp; You can download the source <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/rxtx-2.1-7r2-Java8/rxtx-2.1-7r2-Java8.tar.gz">here</a>.&nbsp; If you want to get a feel for the changes made, take a look at this file:&nbsp; <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/rxtx-2.1-7r2-Java8/JAVA8_MODS.txt"><b><tt>JAVA8_MODS.txt</tt></b></a> which can be found in the main directory of the source code.&nbsp; To build RxTx on your native platform:</p> 
  <pre>   $ tar xvf 2.1.7r2-Java8.tar.gz
   $ cd 2.1.7r2-Java8/
   $ ./configure
   $ make
</pre> 
  <p><b>jSSC </b></p> 
  <p>The Java Simple Serial Connector, or jSSC for short, is another open source project that can be found here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/">http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/</a>.&nbsp; It is available for a host of processor/OS combinations and, in addition to source availability, comes bundled in binary form too.&nbsp; Here's a list of supported platforms for its current 2.6.0 release:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote><a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:Win32" class="label">Win32</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:Win64" class="label">Win64</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:Linux_x86" class="label">Linux_x86</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:Linux_x86_64" class="label">Linux_x86_64</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:Linux_ARM" class="label">Linux_ARM</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:Solaris_x86" class="label">Solaris_x86</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:Solaris_x86_64" class="label">Solaris_x86_64</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:MacOSX_x86" class="label">MacOSX_x86</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:MacOSX_x86_64" class="label">MacOSX_x86_64</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:MacOSX_PPC" class="label">MacOSX_PPC</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/downloads/list?q=label:MacOSX_PPC64" class="label">MacOSX_PPC64</a></blockquote> 
  <p>Like RxTx, it contains a native component but is packaged in a nice transparent fashion.&nbsp; The one potential challenge here may be in trying to figure out how to support a new platform that isn't on this list.&nbsp; I didn't have a whole lot of success finding out how to build the binary, and admittedly didn't spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure it out either.&nbsp; Nonetheless, this project is gaining in popularity and has a dedicated individual supporting the software.</p> 
  <p><b>OpenJDK Device I/O</b></p> 
  <p>Finally, a project is underway to treat serial communication and device I/O in general as a first class citizen for the Java SE standard. The wiki can be found here: <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/dio/Main">https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/dio/Main</a>. It is based on the work done to provide device I/O to the Java ME 8 platform.&nbsp; Further solidifying the universality theme of Java 8, the ultimate goal would be to have a consistent device I/O API across both Java SE and Java ME.&nbsp; If you want to further understand what those APIs look like you can view them here: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javame/8.0/api/dio/api/index.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javame/8.0/api/dio/api/index.html</a>.</p> 
  <p>In conclusion, support for serial communications in Java SE is -- albeit slowly -- progressing.&nbsp; There are multiple open source projects and commercial alternatives too.&nbsp; Ideally, it will be great to see a formal API supported by the Java SE Standard.<br /></p>

<p>Another cross-platform library we use is SerialIO's SerialPort library. It is effective and robust but it has several problems.  (1) it is only supported for 30-90 days after purchase, (2) most support enquiries receive the grumpy response &quot;modify the source and recompile it yourself&quot;, (3) it must be re-purchased every time there is a new platform (e.g. Windows 8, Windows 8.1), (4) it is expensive to re-buy each time especially with source included and (4) it doesn't include any Linux ARM binaries at all (eg. for Raspberry PI) - fiddling about with the source to achieve this is not something we're willing or able to do.</p>

<p>If you wish to comminucate via Java with a PLC and that PLC supports serial commuinication, then yes you should be able to use either the RxTx or jSSC libraries.</p>

<p>Hi Mayur,</p>


<p>I recently blooged about using javahidapi as a means to communicate, via Java, to a USB device.  In this instance the device was a USB temperature sensor, but javahidapi should hopefully be flexible enough for serial port communcation too.</p>


<p>Check out <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/simplifying_usb_access_for_java" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/simplifying_usb_access_for_java</a> which pointo to the javahidapi project: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/</a></p>

<p>Heard about them, but never used it.  I have no reason to believe that it isn't a very effective platform,  Just looking at pricing, a 1000-seat license costs $9995 USD which amounts to a $10 per-seat cost.  On embedded systems, the per-seat cost of deploying a JRE is likely to be less.  Seems without discounting to be a pricy addition.</p>

<p>My bad.  The 100 user per-seat cost (list price) is $995, which is a lot more reasonable.  What I do find annoying though is that they charge for development seats.</p>

<p>Hello guest,</p>


<p>Assuming the shared library in your java.library.path is named libRS2328Bit.so, have you tried a System.LoadLibrary() call without the 'lib' prefix?</p>


<p>System.loadLibrary(&quot;RS2328Bit&quot;);</p>

TITLE: An Embedded Java 8 Lambda Expression Microbenchmark
DATE: 03/17/2014 18:06:36
PRIMARY CATEGORY: Personal
STATUS: publish
ALLOW COMMENTS: 1
-----
BODY: 
<p> It's been a long road, but Java 8 has finally arrived.&nbsp; Much has been written and said about all the new features contained in this release, perhaps the most important of these is the introduction of <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/thejavatutorials/entry/javaone_2013_lambda_expressions">Lambda Expressions</a>.&nbsp; Lambdas are now intimately integrated into the Java platform and they have the potential to aid developers in the traditionally tricky realm of parallel programming.</p> 
  <p>Following closely behind, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/a_first_look_at_compact">Compact Profiles</a> promise to open up the tremendous benefits of Java Standard Edition compatibility to embedded platforms previously thought to be too small.&nbsp; Can you see where this is heading?&nbsp; It might be interesting to use these two technologies simultaneously and see how well they work together.&nbsp; What follows is the description of a small program and its performance measurements -- a microbenchmark if you will -- that aims to highlight how programming with the new Lambda Expression paradigm can be beneficial not only for typical desktops and servers, but also for a growing number of embedded platforms too.</p> 
  <p><b>The Hardware/OS Platform(s)</b></p> 
  <p>Of primary interest for this article is the <a href="http://boundarydevices.com/products/sabre-lite-imx6-sbc/">Boundary Devices BD-SL-i.MX6</a> single board computer.&nbsp; It is a quad-core ARM® Cortex™-A9 based system with 1GB RAM running an <i>armhf</i>&nbsp; Debian Linux distribution.&nbsp; At the time of this article's publication, its list price is US $199.<br /></p> 
  <p><img height="225" width="300" src="http://boundarydevices.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/imx6q_sabrelite_top1-300x225.jpg" class="attachment-medium wp-post-image" alt="imx6q_sabrelite_top1" /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>What makes it more interesting is that we'll not only run Java 8 Lambda Expressions on device, we'll do it within the confines of the new Java 8 Compact1 profile.&nbsp; <i><b>The static footprint of this Java runtime environment is 10½ MB.</b></i></p> 
  <p>A second system, altogether different in capability and capacity from our embedded device will be used as a means to compare and contrast execution behavior across disparate hardware and OS environments.&nbsp; The system in question is a <a href="http://www.toshiba.com/us/computers/laptops/tecra/R840/">Toshiba Tecra R840</a> laptop running Windows 7/64-bit.&nbsp; It has a dual-core Intel® Core™ i5-2520M processor with 8GB RAM and will use the standard Java 8 Runtime Environment (JRE) for Windows 64-bit.<br /></p> 
  <p><b>The Application</b></p> 
  <p>Looking for a sample dataset as the basis for our rudimentary application, <a href="https://launchpad.net/test-db">this link</a> provides an ideal (and fictional) database of employee records.&nbsp; Among the available formats, a comma-delimited CSV file is supplied with approximately 300,000 entries.&nbsp; Our sample application will read this file and store the employee records into a <tt>LinkedList&lt;EmployeeRec&gt;.&nbsp;</tt> The <tt>EmployeeRec</tt> has the following&nbsp; fields:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>public class EmployeeRec {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String id;<br /></tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String birthDate;</tt><br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String lastName;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String firstName;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String gender;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String hireDate;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />}</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>With this data structure initialized, our application is asked to perform one simple task:&nbsp; <b><i>calculate the average age of all male employees</i></b>.</p> 
  <p><b>Old School</b></p> 
  <p>First off let's perform this calculation in a way that predates the availability of Lambda Expressions.&nbsp; We'll call this version <b>OldSchool</b>.&nbsp; The code performing the &quot;average age of all male employees&quot; calculation looks like this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>double sumAge = 0;<br />long numMales = 0;<br />for (EmployeeRec emp : employeeList) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (emp.getGender().equals(&quot;M&quot;)) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sumAge += emp.getAge();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numMales += 1;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />}<br />double avgAge = sumAge / numMales;</tt> </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Lamba Expression Version 1<br /></b></p> 
  <p>Our second variation will use a Lambda expression to perform the identical calculation.&nbsp; We'll call this version <b>Lamba stream()</b>.&nbsp; The key statement in Java 8 looks like this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <tt>double avgAge = employeeList.stream()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .filter(s -&gt; s.getGender().equals(&quot;M&quot;))<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .mapToDouble(s -&gt; s.getAge())<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .average()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .getAsDouble();</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Lambda Expression Version 2</b><br /></p> 
  <p>Our final variation uses the preceding Lambda Expression with one slight modification: it replaces the <tt>stream()</tt> method call with the <tt>parallelStream()</tt> method, offering the potential to split the task into smaller units running on separate threads.&nbsp; We'll call this version <b>Lambda parallelStream()</b>. The Java 8 statement looks as follows:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>double avgAge = employeeList.<b><span style="color: #ff0000;">parallelStream()</span></b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .filter(s -&gt; s.getGender().equals(&quot;M&quot;))<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .mapToDouble(s -&gt; s.getAge())<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .average()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .getAsDouble();</tt> <br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Initial Test Results</b></p> 
  <p>The charts that follow display execution times of the sample problem solved via our three aforementioned variations.&nbsp; The left chart represents times recorded on the ARM Cortex-A9 processor while the right chart shows recorded times for the Intel Core-i5.&nbsp; The smaller the result, the faster, both examples indicate that there is some overhead to utilizing a serial Lambda <tt>stream()</tt> over and above the old school pre-Lambda solution.&nbsp; As far as <tt>parallelStream()</tt> goes, it's a mixed bag.&nbsp; For the Cortex-A9, the <tt>parallelStream()</tt> operation is negligibly faster than the old school solution, whereas for the Core-i5, the overhead incurred by <tt>parallelStream()</tt> actually makes the solution slower.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><img src="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/lambda-microbench/ComputeAvgChart.jpg" /> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Without any further investigation, one might conclude that parallel streams may not be worth the effort. But what if performing a trivial calculation on a list of 300,000 employees simply isn't enough work to show the benefits of parallelization?&nbsp; For this next series of tests, we'll increase the computational load to see how performance might be effected.<br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><b>Adding More Work to the Test<br /></b></p> 
  <p>For this version of the test, we'll solve the same problem, that is to say, calculate the average age of all males, but add a varying amount of intermediate computation.&nbsp; We can variably increase the number of required compute cycles by introducing the following identity method to our programs:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>/* <br />&nbsp;* Rube Goldberg way of calculating identity of 'val',<br />&nbsp;* assuming number is positive<br />&nbsp;*/<br />private static double identity(double val) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double result = 0;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (int i=0; i &lt; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>loopCount</b></span>; i++) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result += Math.sqrt(Math.abs(Math.pow(val, 2)));&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return result / loopCount;</tt><br />}</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As this method takes the square root of the square of a number, it is in essence an expensive identity function. By changing the value of <tt>loopCount</tt> (this is done via command-line option), we can change the number of times this loop executes per <tt>identity()</tt> invocation.&nbsp; This method is inserted into our code, for example with the Lambda ParallelStream() version, as follows:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>double avgAge = employeeList.parallelStream()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .filter(s -&gt; s.getGender().equals(&quot;M&quot;))<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .mapToDouble(<span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>s -&gt; identity(s.getAge())</b></span>)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .average()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .getAsDouble();</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>A modification identical to what is highlighted in red above is also applied to both Old School and Lambda Stream() variations.&nbsp; The charts that follow display execution times for three separate runs of our microbenchmark, each with a different value assigned to the internal <tt>loopCount</tt> variable in our Rube Goldberg <tt>identity()</tt> function.<br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><img src="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/lambda-microbench/ComputeAvgExtraChart.jpg" /> </p> 
  <p>For the Cortex-A9, you can clearly see the performance advantage of <tt>parallelStream()</tt> when the loop count is set to 100, and it becomes even more striking when the loop count is increased to 500.&nbsp; For the Core-i5, it takes a lot more work to realize the benefits of <tt>parallelStream()</tt>.&nbsp; Not until the loop count is set to 50,000 do the performance advantages become apparent.&nbsp; The Core-i5 is so much faster and only has two cores; consequently the amount of effort needed to overcome the initial overhead of <tt>parallelStream()</tt> is much more significant.</p> 
  <p><b>Downloads<br /></b></p> 
  <p> The sample code used in this article is available as a NetBeans project.&nbsp; As the project includes a CSV file with over 300,000 entries, it is larger than one might expect.&nbsp; The <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com">blogs.oracle.com</a>&nbsp; site prohibits storing files larger than 2MB in size so this project source has been compressed and split into three parts.&nbsp; Here are the links:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/lambda-microbench/LambdaMicrobench.zip.part1">LambdaMicrobench.zip.part1</a></li> 
    <li><a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/lambda-microbench/LambdaMicrobench.zip.part2">LambdaMicrobench.zip.part2</a></li> 
    <li><a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/lambda-microbench/LambdaMicrobench.zip.part3">LambdaMicrobench.zip.part3</a></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Just concatenate the three downloaded files together to recreate the original LambdaMicrobench.zip file.&nbsp; In Linux, the command would look something like this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <tt>$ cat LambdaMicrobench.zip.part? &gt; LambdaMicrobench.zip</tt><br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> </ul><a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/lambda-microbench/LambdaMicrobench.zip.part1"></a><b>Conclusion</b><br /> 
  <p>A great deal of effort has been put into making Java 8 a much more universal platform.&nbsp; Our simple example here demonstrates that even an embedded Java runtime environment as small as 10½ MB can take advantage of the latest advances to the platform.&nbsp; This is just the beginning.&nbsp; There is lots more work to be done to further enhance the performance characteristics of parallel stream Lambda Expressions.&nbsp; We look forward to future enhancements.<br /></p>

<p>The title is misleading. The lambda expressions do not improve upon traditional processing at all. It's the parallel processing that improves things.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>


<p>I have downloaded the benchmark but could not successfully build it. I have just run the command : ant -buildfile build.xml</p>


<p>I get an error concerning the properties and then when I include them using -Duser.properties=/path. I still get an error</p>


<p>Is there a readme file on how to build this thank you.</p>

<p>Normally these projects would run within the context of NetBeans, but as they are built using ant, I see how you'd like to try running these outside the IDE.</p>


<p>In order to get this to run outside NeBeans, on an Ubuntu 14.05 system, I did the following:</p>


<p>1. Install the latest Java 8 JDK (JDK 1.8.0 Update 45) and put it in my<br/>
   $PATH (/home/jimc/jdk1.8.0_45/bin)<br/>
2. Install ant ($sudo apt-get install ant)<br/>
3. Download and extract the LambdaMicroBench project.  This creates a<br/>
   LambdaMicrobench/ directory<br/>
4. To build, inside the LambdaMicrobench/ directory, type:</p>


<p>    $ ant -Dplatforms.jdk_1.8.home=$HOME/jdk1.8.0_45</p>


<p>You may have to change the location of the JDK directory</p>


<p>5. Once built, sample runs include:</p>


<p>$ java -cp dist/LambdaMicrbench.jar lambdademo.LambdaAvgExtraParallel 50000</p>


<p>$ java -cp dist/LambdaMicrbench.jar lambdademo.OldSchoolAvgExtra 50000</p>


<p>Hope this helps,<br/>

<p>Sounds like you may have started java in an unexpected directory?</p>


<p>Are you in the LambdaMicrobench/ directory?  Dependng upon how the zip file was extracted, there may be an additional LambdaMicrobench/ directory underneath this one.  You want to be in the directory which contains:</p>


<p>   build.xml<br/>
   manifest.mf<br/>
   nbproject<br/>
   src</p>


<p>before the build takes place.</p>


<p>Also, thinking that this may have been a Windows problem, I did confirm that, once properly configured, you can also use ant to build and run these programs from a Windows DOS command shell. </p>

TITLE: Introducing the EJDK

PRIMARY CATEGORY: Sun
STATUS: publish
ALLOW COMMENTS: 1

BODY: 
<p>In lock step with the introduction of <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/a_first_look_at_compact">Compact Profiles</a>, Java 8 includes a new distribution mechanism for Java SE Embedded called the <i>EJDK</i>.&nbsp; As the potential exists to confuse the EJDK with the standard JDK (Java Development Kit), it makes sense to dedicate a few words towards highlighting how these two packages differ in form and function. <br /></p> 
  <p><b>The JDK</b></p> 
  <p>The venerable Java Development Kit is the mainstay of Java developers.&nbsp; It incorporates not only a standard Java Runtime Environment (JRE), but also includes critical tools required by those same developers.&nbsp; For example, among many others, the JDK comes with a Java compiler (<tt>javac</tt>), a Java console application (<tt>jconsole</tt>), the Java debugger (<tt>jdb</tt>) and the Java archive utility (<tt>jar</tt>).&nbsp; It also serves as the underpinnings for very popular Java Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as <a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/jdev/overview/index.html">JDeveloper</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> to name a few.</p> 
  <p>Like Java, the Java Development Kit is constantly evolving, and Java 8 brings about its fair share of enhancements to the JDK.&nbsp; For Java 8, <tt>javac</tt> can now be instructed (via the <tt>-profile</tt> command-line option) to insure that your source code is compatible with a specific compact profile.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Java 8 JDK comes with a new useful tool called <tt>jdeps</tt>, providing a means to analyze your compiled class and jar files for dependencies.<br /></p> 
  <p><b>The EJDK</b></p> 
  <p>The EJDK is new to Java 8, and although similar in namesake to the JDK, it serves quite a different purpose.&nbsp; Prior to Java 8, supported Java SE-Embedded runtime platforms were provided as binaries by Oracle.&nbsp; With the advent of Compact Profiles, the number of possible binary options per supported platform would simply be too unweildy.&nbsp; Rather than furnishing binaries for each of the possible combinations, an EJDK will be supplied for each supported Java SE-Embedded platform.&nbsp; It contains the tools needed to create the profile you wish to use.</p> 
  <p>The EJDK is designed to be run with either Windows or Linux/Unix platforms alongside a Java runtime environment.&nbsp; It contains a wrapper called <i>jrecreate</i> (<tt>jrecreate.sh</tt> for Unix/Linux and <tt>jrecreate.bat</tt> for Windows) whose function it is to create deployable compact profile instances. In the examples that follow, we'll show two sample invocations.</p> 
  <p>First off, let's briefly take a look at the contents of a typical EJDK. &nbsp; For our first example, we've installed the EJDK on a linux/x86 system. &nbsp; Listing the contents of the <tt>ejdk1.8.0/</tt> directory, we see a subdirectory named <tt>linux_arm_vfp_hflt/</tt>.&nbsp; This tells us what platform this instance of the EJDK supports.&nbsp; For all our examples we'll use an EJDK that creates compact profiles suitable for Linux/Arm Hard Float platform, often times referred to as <i>armhf.</i><br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ ls ejdk1.8.0<br />bin&nbsp; doc&nbsp; lib&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>linux_arm_vfp_hflt</b></span></tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Looking one level deeper into the <tt>bin/</tt> directory, we see the <tt>jrecreate.bat</tt> and <tt>jrecreate.sh</tt> files:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ ls ejdk1.8.0/bin<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>jrecreate.bat</b></span>&nbsp; jrecreate.config.properties&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>jrecreate.sh</b></span></tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As we're on a Linux system, let's use the <tt>jrecreate.sh</tt> script to create a compact profile:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ ./ejdk1.8.0/bin/jrecreate.sh --profile compact1 --dest compact1-minimal --vm minimal</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Briefly reviewing this invocation, the <tt>--profile compact1</tt> option instructs <tt>jrecreate</tt> to use the Compact1 profile.&nbsp; The <tt>--profile</tt> option accepts [<tt>compact1 | compact2 | compact3</tt>]&nbsp; as an argument. The <tt>--dest compact1-minimal</tt> option specifies the name of the destination directory containing the newly generated profile.&nbsp; Note that the directory argument to <tt>--dest</tt> must not exist prior to invocation.&nbsp; Finally, the <tt>--vm minimal</tt> option tells <tt>jrecreate</tt> to use the minimal (i.e. the smallest) virtual machine for this instance.&nbsp; The <tt>--vm</tt> option accepts&nbsp; <tt>[minimal | client | server | all]</tt> as an argument.&nbsp; Running the complete <tt>jrecreate.sh</tt> command, we get the following output:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ ./ejdk1.8.0/bin/jrecreate.sh --profile compact1 --dest compact1-minimal --vm minimal<br />Building JRE using Options {<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; ejdk-home: /home/java8/ejdk1.8.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dest: /home/java8/compact1-minimal<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; target: linux_arm_vfp_hflt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vm: minimal<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; runtime: compact1 profile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debug: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep-debug-info: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no-compression: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dry-run: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verbose: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extension: []<br />}<br /><br />Target JRE Size is 10,595 KB (on disk usage may be greater).<br />Embedded JRE created successfully</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This creates a Compac1 profile distribution of about 10 ½ MB in the <tt>compact-1-minimal/</tt> directory.&nbsp; For our second example, we'll create a profile based on Compact2 and the client VM, this time from a Windows 7/64-bit system:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>c:\demo&gt;ejdk1.8.0\bin\jrecreate.bat --profile compact2 --dest compact2-client --vm client<br />Building JRE using Options {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ejdk-home: c:\demo\ejdk1.8.0\bin\..<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dest: c:\demo\compact2-client<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; target: linux_arm_vfp_hflt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vm: client<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; runtime: compact2 profile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debug: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep-debug-info: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no-compression: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dry-run: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verbose: false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extension: []<br />}<br /><br />Target JRE Size is 17,552 KB (on disk usage may be greater).<br />Embedded JRE created successfully</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This Compact2 instance is created in the <tt>compact2-client/</tt> directory and has an approximate footprint of 17 ½ MB.&nbsp; Additional options to <tt>jrecreate</tt> are available for further customization. <br /></p> 
  <p>Finally, lets migrate the generated profiles over to a real device.&nbsp; As a host platform we'll use none other than the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.&nbsp; Here's a listing of the two profiles and their size (in 1K blocks) on the filesystem:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>pi@pi0 ~/java8 $ ls<br />compact1-minimal&nbsp; compact2-client<br /><br />pi@pi0 ~/java8 $ du -sk compact*<br />10616&nbsp;&nbsp; compact1-minimal<br />17660&nbsp;&nbsp; compact2-client</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And here's what each version outputs when <tt>java -version</tt> is run: <br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>pi@pi0 ~/java8 $ ./compact1-minimal/bin/java -version<br />java version &quot;1.8.0&quot;<br />Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0-b127, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>profile compact1</b></span>, headless)<br />Java HotSpot(TM) Embedded <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>Minimal VM</b></span> (build 25.0-b69, mixed mode)<br /><br />pi@pi0 ~/java8 $ ./compact2-client/bin/java -version<br />java version &quot;1.8.0&quot;<br />Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0-b127, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>profile compact2</b></span>, headless)<br />Java HotSpot(TM) Embedded <span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>Client VM</b></span> (build 25.0-b69, mixed mode)</tt><br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> In conclusion, you are encouraged to experiment with the EJDK.&nbsp; It will very quickly give you a feel for the compact profile configuration options available for your device.<br /></p>

<p>That's because there is nio EJDK for Windows.  The EJDK is the distribution mechanism for Java SE-Embedded runtime environments.  As of this reply, the following platforms are supported:</p>


<p>ARMv7 Linux VFP Hard Float<br/>
ARMv6/7 Linux VFP Soft Float<br/>
ARMv5 Linux Soft Float<br/>
PowerPC e600 Linux Classic Floating Point<br/>
PowerPC e500v2 Linux SPE Floating Point<br/>

<p>Correct, Compact Profiles are a fundamantal part of Java SE-Embedded, however if you're ambitious you can build an OpenJDK version from source.  An additional blog entry: <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/compact_profiles_demonstrated," rel="nofollow">https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/compact_profiles_demonstrated,</a> says the following:</p>


<p> &quot;It's not as intimidating as it sounds, you can pull down the source code for OpenJDK 8, and build it yourself. By default, compact profiles are not built, but this forum post (<a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8-dev/2013-February/002062.html)shows" rel="nofollow">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8-dev/2013-February/002062.html)shows</a> you how.  The reference platform for this software is linux/x86.  Functionally, the generated compact profiles will contain the pared down modules for each compact profile, but you'll find the footprint for each to be much larger than the ones demonstrated in this video, as none of the Java SE-Embedded space optimizations are performed by default.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm trying to install java on an ARM v5 platform (Debian). I've extracted the ejdk on /opt/java/ folder. <br/>
But when i'm trying to launch the install script, there is this message : </p>


<p>./jrecreate.sh: 12: /opt/java/bin/java: not found</p>


<p>Can someone help me ? I need Java 8 on this machine and not other version.</p>

<p>Looking back on this entry, it may not be entirely clear that in order to use the eJDK, you must also have a Java Runtime Environment installed on the same system as the eJDK (not the target system).  The jrecreate.sh script actually starts up a Java program to generate Compact Profiles.</p>


<p>First suggestion is to (1) check to see that you have a JRE installed, (2) that the 'java' executable is in your PATH and (3) the JAVA_HOME variable is set accordingly.  For example:</p>


<p>$ echo $PATH<br/>
/home/jimc/jdk1.7.0_55/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/jimc/ct-ng/bin</p>


<p>$ java -version<br/>
java version &quot;1.7.0_55&quot;<br/>
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)<br/>
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)</p>


<p>$ echo $JAVA_HOME<br/>
/home/jimc/jdk1.7.0_55</p>

<p>Combined with yours, I have now a usable Java8 JRE on my ARM platform. <br/>
Thank you again</p>

<p>You're probably asking yourself, &quot;Pricing?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; In a techie blog?&quot;, and I would normally agree wholeheartedly with your assessment.&nbsp; But in this one instance the topic might be worthy of a few words.&nbsp; There is, as the expression goes, no such thing as a free lunch.&nbsp; Whether you pay for software outright, or roll your own with open source projects, a cost must be paid.</p> 
  <p>Like clockwork, we regularly receive inquiries for Java embedded information that go something like this:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Dear Oracle,&nbsp; We've downloaded and evaluated Java SE-Embedded and have found it to be a very appealing platform to run our embedded application.&nbsp; We understand this is commercial software; before we decide to deploy our solution with your runtime, can you give us a feel for the royalties associated with shipping x number of units?</i></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Seems pretty straightforward, right?&nbsp; Well, yes, except that in the past Oracle required the potential customer to sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to receiving any embedded pricing information.&nbsp; It didn't matter if the customer was interested in deploying ten units or ten thousand, they all had to go through this process.&nbsp; Now certain aspects of pricing may still require confidential agreements, but why not make quantity 1 list prices available?&nbsp;&nbsp; With the release of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/pricing/price-lists/java-embedded-price-list-1977272.pdf">this document</a>, that pricing information is now public.</p> 
  <p>The evidence is out there, both anecdotal and real, demonstrating that 
Oracle's Java SE-Embedded platform is unquestionably superior in quality
 and performance to the OpenJDK variants.&nbsp; For the latest example, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/comparing_arm_linux_jvms_revisited#javase-e-vs-openjdk">take a look at this blog entry</a>.&nbsp;
 So the question becomes, is it actually more affordable to pay for a 
commercial platform that is fully supported, faster and more reliable or
 to opt for a &quot;free&quot; platform and support it yourself. <br /></p> 
  <p><b>So What Does Java SE-Embedded Cost?</b></p> 
  <p> The universal answer to such a question is: <i>it depends</i>.&nbsp; That is to say it depends upon the capability of the embedded processor.&nbsp; Before we lose you, let's show the list price for Java embedded licensing associated with three platforms and then explain how we arrived at the numbers.&nbsp; As of the posting of this entry, 06 December, 2013, here they are:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>Per-unit cost for a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">Raspberry Pi</a>: US $0.71</li> 
    <li>Per-unit cost for system based on <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/41175/Intel-Atom-Processor-Z510P-512K-Cache-1_10-GHz-400-MHz-FSB">Intel Atom Z510P</a>: US $2.68<br /></li> 
    <li>Per-unit cost for a Compulab <a href="http://utilite-computer.com/web/trim-slice">Trim-Slice</a>: US $5.36<br /></li> 
  </ol> 
  <p><b>How Does It Work?</b></p> 
  <p>These bullet points help describe the process, then we'll show how we arrived at our three sample platform prices. 
  </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Pricing is done on a per-core basis.</li> 
    <li>Processors are classified based on their capability and assigned a core factor.&nbsp; The more capable the processor, the higher the core factor.</li> 
    <li>Per-core pricing is determined by multiplying the standard per-core Java embedded price by the core factor.</li> 
    <li>A 19% Software Update License &amp; Support Fee is automatically added onto each system.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The core factor table that follows, found in the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/pricing/price-lists/java-embedded-price-list-1977272.pdf">Oracle Java Embedded Global Price List, dated September 20, 2013</a>, groups processors of similar capabilities into buckets called chip classes.&nbsp; Each chip class is assigned a core factor.</p>

/></p> 
  <ul> </ul> 
  <p><b>Example 1</b></p> 
  <p>To compute the per-unit cost, use this formula:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Oracle Java Embedded per-core license fee&nbsp; *&nbsp; core factor&nbsp; *&nbsp; number of cores&nbsp; *&nbsp; support uplift</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The standard per-core license fee is always $300.&nbsp; The Raspberry Pi is a Class I device and therefore has a core factor of .002.&nbsp; There is only one core in the Raspberry Pi, and the Software Update License &amp; Support fee is always 19%.&nbsp; So plugging in the numbers, we get:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>$300&nbsp; *&nbsp; .002&nbsp; *&nbsp; 1&nbsp; *&nbsp; 1.19&nbsp; =&nbsp; $0.714<br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Example 2</b></p> 
  <p>The processor in this example, the Intel Atom Z510P, is a Class II device and has a core factor of .0075.&nbsp; Using the same formula from Example 1, here's what we get:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>$300&nbsp; *&nbsp; .0075&nbsp; *&nbsp; 1&nbsp; *&nbsp; 1.19&nbsp; =&nbsp; $2.6775 <br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Example 3</b></p> 
  <p>The processor for the Trim-Slice is based on the ARM Cortex-A9, a Class II device.&nbsp; Furthermore it is a dual-core system.&nbsp; Using the same formula as the previous examples, we arrive at the following per-unit pricing:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>$300&nbsp; *&nbsp; .0075&nbsp; *&nbsp; 2&nbsp; *&nbsp; 1.19&nbsp; = $5.355</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> 
  <p>With your hardware specs handy, you should now have enough information to make a reasonable estimate of Oracle Java embedded licensing costs.&nbsp; At minimum, it could be a help in your &quot;buy vs. roll your own&quot; decision making process.&nbsp; And of course, if you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask.<br /></p> 
  <p><br /></p>

<p>Hello Jim,<br/>
thanks for the clarification. I still have one open question regarding support/maintenance. Assuming we deliver a device with a embedded JavaVM and we payed also the 19% support fee. Now, if we would have to deliver a patch for that VM in two years or three, is that covered by the fee? There is no hint if that fee is an annual fee or a fixed one.<br/>
An answer would be much appreciated.<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Wolfgang</p>

<p>Hi Wolfgang,</p>


<p>The support fee is annual.  Provided your're paying the annual support fee, you can update and upgrade your deployed Java Runtime Environments. <br/>
Support is not mandatory but strongly, repeat strongly recommended.</p>


<p>Regards,<br/>

<p>Hi Jim<br/>
thanks for excellent information, my question is, who is paying the price? is it the hardware manufacturer or the software vendor (me)</p>


<p>and one more question please<br/>
Where I can find or how I can find suitable hardware To run Embedded Java or Java ME Embedded ?  is there any list?</p>


<p>thanks in  advance. </p>

<p>In terms of royalty payments, at this juncture, it would be you, the software vendor.</p>


<p>As far as suitable hardware, for Java SE-Embedded, we just offer guidelines.  If your harware matches the requirements, it should work.  Check out: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/resources/se-embeddocs/index.html#sysreqs" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/resources/se-embeddocs/index.html#sysreqs</a></p>


<p>There are a much smaller number of supported Java ME platforms.  My recommendation would be to get a Raspberry Pi.  It can run both Java SE-Embedded and Java ME Embedded.  It makes for a real inexpensive development and reference platform. </p>

<p>Hello Jim</p>


<p>Do you know if it is there a minimum quantity of licenses to buy each time ? ( 10, 100, 1000, 10000 )</p>


<p>Also, do you know if Java ME and/or Java Embedded ME/SE has to pay a license fee ?</p>


<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Caroline,</p>


<p>There is no mimimum quantity.  That being said, asking for say 10 licenses might not get you a whole lot of attention :)</p>


<p>Java ME and Java SE Embedded both need to be licensed when solutions are deployed with this technology.  Almost certainly, Java ME devices will not be any larger than Chip Class I category.  For Java ME, especially if volumes are high, you should get contact Oracle sales to get a better understanding of how it may be priced.</p>

<p>Hi Jim</p>


<p>With your comment &quot;might not get you a whole lot of attention&quot;, you mean that if I do not develop a solution for thousands, I can not develop anything because I will not have the licenses I need ? </p>


<p>Which is the minimum quantity that Oracle will be interested in selling ?</p>


<p>What if I will start developing something and I want to buy licenses as the business grow ? </p>


<p>If I develop something to use privately, I have to buy a license too ?</p>


<p>Thanks in advance<br/>
Caroline</p>

<p>With respect to development, you are free to use Java SE-Embedded for development purposes.  When you deploy commercially, a redistribution license applies.</p>


<p>There is no minimum quantity.  I believe we are trying to direct these smaller type opportunities to our Partner Business Consultants (PBCs).  If you're looking to speak to someone, let me know.</p>

<p>Hello Jim, thanks for posting this.</p>


<p>Are your numbers here still relevant today? For instance, Raspberry Pi is now a 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU. If I understand your numbers correctly, the price of putting Oracle Java on an rPi 3 is $10.71 ($300 * .0075 * 4 * 1.19), an increase of 15x. </p>


<p>When I've seen this kind of thing in the past, it's because the licensing hasn't kept pace with Moore's Law and eventually gets adjusted toward a more competitive unit cost. Forward development of the JVM requires community support and I think myself and others want to be a part of that, but as you know there are also efforts around LLVM such as with Scala Native that will someday provide benefits that cannot be matched in a virtualized environment at any price. So there's a lot to think about.</p>


<p>Any thoughts here? Thanks!</p>

<p>Those numbers are, at the current time still valid.  Sorry I can't provide additional information, looks like we need to revisit in light of other advances too, like for instance the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero.  </p>

<p>I think Oracle is crazy.  Use OpenJDK.  Your device is already using open-source Linux which is far more complicated compared to Java JDK -- so why fear OpenJDK?  If you trust open-source linux then trust OpenJDK.</p>

BODY: 
<p>Having sold more than <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5016">1.75 million units in its brief lifespan</a>, there is no denying the profound impact the Raspberry Pi has had on the embedded development community.&nbsp; Amid all the hoopla surrounding the recently completed <a href="http://www.oracle.com/openworld/index.html">Oracle OpenWorld</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">Java One</a> events, one announcement that flew under the radar dealt with the fact that the <i>Oracle JDK is now part of the Raspberry Pi Raspian distribution</i>.
</p>
<p>This means that by default, when you download and install the latest Raspian distribution on your Raspberry Pi,&nbsp;the Oracle Java runtime environment and development tools&nbsp;are&nbsp;automatically part of the list of packages installed.&nbsp; Here's a screenshot showing a login session to a Raspberry Pi running the 2013-09-25-wheezy-raspian distribution.&nbsp; The JDK is installed as the <i>oracle-java7-jdk</i> package and is utilizing the Java 7u40 release.
  <br />
</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/raspberry-pi/pi-oracle-jdk.jpg" />
</p>
<p>For those who either cannot or do not wish to perform an entire Raspian upgrade, the Oracle JDK is available via the following command:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Great news.

<p>Hi</p>


<p>Does that mean if I buy a RASPBERRY PI STARTER KIT, RASPIAN, CASED-UK it will come with Java installed?</p>


<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If the Raspberry Pi Starter Kit contains contains latest Raspian distribution, then yes.  But if the starter kit has been sitting in inventory for a while, it may contain an older version.  In this case, as the blog states, a one line command can be issued to get Java SE-Embedded installed.</p>

<p>Hmm,  just thinking off the top of my head, is it possible you're not using the Raspbian (armhf) distribution and instead have one of the older Debian (armel) distros?</p>

<p>To avoid any confusion, the wording of this blog has been modified to reflect the fact that the Oracle Java added to Raspian was the Oracle JDK, not Java SE-Embedded as originally stated.  The primary difference here is that the JDK footprint, including development tools and all, is significantly larger than the Java SE-E footprint.  If you would prefer to use Java SE-Embedded, you can download it here: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html.</a></p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I have some experience with Java, but am new to Raspberry.</p>


<p>Do the Java Security Libraries work fine on Raspberry? In particular, is it possible to generate RSA Keys on Raspberry using Java? If yes, are these Keys known to have any Cryptographic Weaknesses?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Do the Java Security Libraries work fine on Raspberry?</p>


<p>Yes.  This is a Java SE Complaint JDK that contains all of the features and functionality found with Java SE on platforms like Windows, Solaris and Linux</p>


<p>&gt;&gt; In particular, is it possible to generate RSA Keys on Raspberry using Java?<br/>
Yes.  Take a look at the keytool(1) utility that comes with the JDK.</p>


<p>&gt;&gt; If yes, are these Keys known to have any Cryptographic Weaknesses?<br/>
Take a look at <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/strengthening_signatures_part_2" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/strengthening_signatures_part_2</a><br/>
Oracle along with other major vendors (like Microsoft) are insisting that signatures generated with MD5 be phased out.</p>

BODY: 
<p>It's been about 18 months since we last compared Linux/Arm JVMs, and with the formal&nbsp;release of the much anticipated <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">Java SE Embedded for Arm hard float</a> binary, it marks a good time to revisit JVM performance.&nbsp; The&nbsp;information and results&nbsp;that follow will highlight the following comparisons:
</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li><a href="#armel-vs-armhf">Java SE-E Arm VFP (armel) vs. Arm Hard Float (armhf) </a></li> 
    <li><a href="#c1-vs-c2">Java SE-E armhf Client Compiler (c1) vs. armhf Server Compiler (c2) </a> </li> 
    <li>And last but certainly not least ... <a href="#javase-e-vs-openjdk">Java SE-E 7u40 armhf vs. Open JDK armhf</a> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p><b>The Benchmark</b></p> 
  <p>For the sake of simplicity and consistency, we'll use a subset of the <a href="http://www.dacapobench.org/">DaCapo benchmark suite</a>.&nbsp; It's an open source group of real world applications that put a good strain on a system both from a processor and memory workload perspective. We are aware of customers who use DaCapo to gauge performance, and due to its availability and ease of use, enables anyone interested to run their own set of tests in fairly short order.<br /></p> 
  <p><b>The Hardware</b></p> 
  <p> It would have been grand to run all these benchmarks on one platform, most notably the beloved <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but unfortunately it has its limitations:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>There is no Java SE-E server compiler (c2) for the Raspberry Pi.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the Pi is based on an ARMv6 instruction set whereas the Java SE-E c2 compiler requires a minimum ARMv7 instruction set.</li> 
    <li>Demonstrating how rapidly advances are being made in the hardware arena, the Raspberry Pi, within the context of these tests, is quite a humble platform.&nbsp; With 512MB RAM, it runs out of memory when running some of the large DaCapo component applications.</li> 
  </ul>For these tests we'll primarily use a quad-core Cortex-A9 based system, and for one test we'll utilize a single core Marvell Armada system just to compare what effect the number of cores has on server compiler performance.&nbsp; The devices in question are: 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ol> 
    <li>Boundary Devices BD-SL-i.MX6, quad core 1GHz Cortex-A9 (Freescale i.MX6), 1GB RAM, Debian Wheezy distribution, 3.0.35 kernel (for both armel and armhf configurations)<br /></li> 
    <li>GlobalScale D2Plug, single core 800MHz ARMv6/v7 processor (Marvell PXA510), 1GB RAM, Debian Wheezy distribution, 3.5.3-cubox-di+ kernel for armhf<br /></li> 
  </ol> <a name="armel-vs-armhf"></a> 
  <blockquote> </blockquote> 
  <p><b>Java SE-E <i>armel</i> vs. <i>armhf</i></b></p> 
  <p>The chart that follows compares the relative performance of the <i>armel</i> JavaSE-E 7u40 JRE with the <i>armhf</i> JavaSE-E 7u40 JRE for 8 of the DaCapo component applications.&nbsp; These tests were conducted on the Boundary Devices BD-SL-i.MX6.&nbsp; Both armel and armhf environments were based on the Debian Wheezy distribution running a 3.0.35 kernel.&nbsp; For all charts, the smaller the result, the faster the run.<br /></p>

  <p>In all 8 tests, the armhf binary is faster, some only slightly, and in one case (eclipse) a few percentage points faster.&nbsp; The big performance gain associated with the armhf standard deals with floating point operations, and in particular, the passing of arguments directly into floating point registers.&nbsp; The performance gains realized by the newer armhf 
standard will be seen more in the native application realm than 
for Java SE-Embedded primarily because&nbsp; the Java SE-E armel VM already uses FP registers for Java floating point methods.&nbsp; There are still however certain floating point workloads that may show a modest performance increase (in the single digit percent range) with JavaSE-E armhf over Java SE-E armel.</p> <a name="c1-vs-c2"></a> 
  <p><b>Java SE-E Client Compiler (c1) vs. Server Compiler (c2)</b></p> 
  <p>In this section, we'll show tests results for two different platforms, 
the first a single core system, followed by the same tests on a 
quad-core system.&nbsp; To further demonstrate how workload changes 
performance, we'll take advantage of the ability to run the DaCapo component applications
 in three different modes: small, default (medium) and large.&nbsp; The first
 chart displays the aggregate time required to run the tests for the 
three modes, utilizing both the 7u40 client (c1) compiler and the server
 (c2) compiler.&nbsp; As expected, c1 outperforms c2 by a wide margin for the tests that run only briefly.&nbsp; As 
the total time to run the tests increases from small to large, the c2 
compiler gets a chance to &quot;warm up&quot; and close the gap in performance.&nbsp;

  <p>Contrast the first chart with the one that follows where small, medium and large versions of the tests were run on a quad core system.&nbsp; The c2 compiler is better able to utilize the additional compute resources supplied by this platform, the result being that initial gap in performance between c1 and c2 for the small version of the test is only 19%.&nbsp; By the time we reach the large version, c2 outperforms c1 by 7%.&nbsp; The moral of the story here is, given enough resources, the server compiler might be the better of the VMs for your workload if it is a long-lived process.<br /></p>

  <p>The OpenJDK packages were pulled from the Debian Wheezy distribution.</p> 
  <p>It appears the bulk of performance work to OpenJDK/Arm still revolves around the OpenJDK 6 platform even though Java 7 was released over two years ago (and Java 8 is coming soon).&nbsp; Regardless, Java SE still outperforms most OpenJDK tests by a wide margin, and perhaps more importantly appears to be the much more reliable platform considering the number of tests that failed with the OpenJDK variants.&nbsp; As <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/part_deux_comparing_jvms_on">demonstrated in previous benchmark results</a>, the older armel OpenJDK VMs appear to be more stable than the armhf versions tested here.&nbsp; Considering the stated direction by the major linux distributions is to migrate towards the armhf binary standard, this is a bit eye opening.<br /> </p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to record this. It's great to see modularity progress in Java 8.<br/>
Where are compact profiles defined and documented? Can I create my own?<br/>
Have SDK tools (maybe javac itself) been enhanced to compute the smallest profile for a given application ?<br/>
In other words was there a way to statically detect that Felix would not load the bundle on the compact1 profile?</p>

<p>Hi Alexis,</p>


<p>To your questions:</p>


<p>1. In terms of documentation, the best place to look currently is the JEP (Java Enhancement Proposal for Compact Profiles <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161)." rel="nofollow">http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161).</a>  If you have access (OPN Gold) to the early access builds, there is some additional documentation in the bundle.</p>


<p>2. For Java 8 we are providing 3 defined subsets of the JRE and providing a tool called jrecreate that will enable you to do some customizations on the defined profiles themselves.  For example, you can choose the type of VM (minimal, client, server) the should be associated with the created profile.  The ability to create your own custom runtime based on the profile of your application is a feature we will be providing in Java 9.</p>


<p>3. Compact Profiles bring with it a series of enhancements to Java development tools.  In particular, &quot;javac -profile&quot; will check to see if your source code references an api not in the specified profile.  If that is the case, javac will not compile the source.   </p>

BODY: 
<p> Java SE is a very impressive platform indeed, but with all that functionality comes a large and ever increasing footprint.&nbsp; It stands to reason then that one of the more frequent requests from the community has been the desire to deploy only those components required for a particular application instead of the entire Java SE runtime environment.&nbsp; Referred to as subsetting, the benefits of such a concept would seem to be many:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>A smaller Java environment would require less compute resources, thus opening up a new domain of devices previously thought to be too humble for Java.</li> 
    <li>A smaller runtime environment could be better optimized for performance and start up time.</li> 
    <li>Elimination of unused code is always a good idea from a security perspective.</li> 
    <li>If the environment could be pared down significantly, there may be tremendous benefit to bundling runtimes with each individual Java application.</li> 
    <li>These bundled applications could be downloaded more quickly.<br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Despite these perceived advantages, the platform stewards (Sun, then Oracle) have been steadfast in their resistance to subsetting.&nbsp; The rationale for such a stance is quite simple: there was sincere concern that the Java SE platform would fragment.&nbsp; Agree or disagree, the Java SE standard has remained remarkably in tact over time.&nbsp; If you need any further evidence of this assertion, compare the state of Java SE to that of Java ME, particularly in the mobile telephony arena.&nbsp; Better still, look how quickly Android has spawned countless variants in its brief lifespan.</p> 
  <p>Nonetheless, a formal effort has been underway having the stated goal of providing a much more modular Java platform.&nbsp; Called <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/">Project Jigsaw</a>, when complete, Java SE will be composed of a set of finer-grained modules and will include tools to enable developers to identify and isolate only those modules needed for their application.&nbsp; However, implementing this massive internal change and yet maintaining compatibility has proven to be a considerable challenge.&nbsp; Consequently <a href="http://mreinhold.org/blog/late-for-the-train">full implementation of the modular Java platform has been delayed until Java 9</a>.</p> 
  <p>Understanding that Java 9 is quite a ways off, an interim solution will be available for Java 8, called <b><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161">Compact Profiles</a></b>.&nbsp; Rather than specifying a complete module system, Java 8 will define subset profiles of the Java SE platform specification that developers can use to deploy.&nbsp; At the current time three compact profiles have been defined, and have been assigned the creative names <i>compact1</i>, <i>compact2</i>, and <i>compact3</i>. The table that follows lists the packages that comprise each of the profiles.&nbsp; Each successive profile is a superset of its predecessor.&nbsp; That is to say, the compact2 profile contains all of the packages in compact1 plus those listed under the compact2 column below.&nbsp; Likewise, compact3 contains all of compact2 packages plus the ones listed in the compact3 column.<br /></p>

  <p>You may ask what savings can be realized by using compact profiles?&nbsp; As Java 8 is in pre-release stage, numbers will change over time, but let's take a look at a snapshot early access build of Java SE-Embedded 8 for ARMv5/Linux.&nbsp; <i>A reasonably configured compact1 profile comes in at less than 14MB</i>.&nbsp; Compact2 is about 18MB and compact3 is in the neighborhood of 21MB.&nbsp; For reference, the latest Java 7u21 SE Embedded ARMv5/Linux environment requires 45MB.</p> 
  <p>So at less than one-third the original size of the already space-optimized Java SE-Embedded release, you have a very capable runtime environment.&nbsp; If you need the additional functionality provided by the compact2 and compact3 profiles or even the full VM, you have the option of deploying your application with them instead.</p> 
  <p>In the next installment, we'll look at Compact Profiles in a bit more detail.<br /></p>

<p>Don't any tools exist to produce a stripped down JVM containing a minimal footprint needed to run a particular application ?  Given how much information is kept in jar files, and given how long the jvm has been around - this doesn't sound like asking for a miracle... </p>

<p>This seems to be very much on lines of plug-able and composable runtime with pre-build profiles. Can not this be custom? Or it is J2SE 9 goal? </p>


<p>Next set of App servers will also have to provide such a capability making things to be available in a composable way and then on-demand, something that WAS Liberty is already able to do.</p>

<p>The custom capability you ask for will be part of Java 9.  Compact Profiles are an interim solution which subset the JRE into a small number of options, each with well known functionality.  As Java 9 won't be out for quite a bit, compact profiles aren't going away any time soon.  In fact we've modified many Java SE tools to compact profile aware, including javac, jar and the java command.</p>

<p>The concept of compact profile is a good start. </p>


<p>I would think one can customize these because many applications/projects would have classes/libraries that overlap at least two of these profiles.</p>

<p>Referring to the subsequent blog post entitled Compact Profiles Demonstrated (<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/compact_profiles_demonstrated)," rel="nofollow">https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/compact_profiles_demonstrated),</a> the full toolset and space optimizations are only available for Java SE-Embedded.  However, you can use a form of Compact Profiles with the standard OpenJDK release:</p>


<p>&quot;It's not as intimidating as it sounds, you can pull down the source code for OpenJDK 8, and build it yourself (<a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/raw-file/tip/README-builds.html)." rel="nofollow">http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/raw-file/tip/README-builds.html).</a>  By default, compact profiles are not built, but this forum post shows you how (<a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8-dev/2013-February/002062.html)." rel="nofollow">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8-dev/2013-February/002062.html).</a>  The reference platform for this software is linux/x86.

<p>I keep trying to figure out a how to get jdwp to work with Embedded Java, using either a full jre or compact3 profile.  In both cases, it cannot find libjdwp.so.</p>


<p>According to the document below, it should be supported, except in the minimal VM option of the JRE.  I am using the ARMv5 Linux (linux-arm-sflt) version, which I suspect might not include this anymore?  It was in the EJRE7 though, so I'm surprised it is missing now.  Does anyone know about this?</p>

<p>In general, our experience is that customers have had good success moving applications from CDC to Java SE Embedded with Compact Profiles.  With compact1, migration from CDC/FP to Java 8 SE was one of the main factors determining which APIs were and were not not included.</p>


<p>That being said we cannot guarantee all CDC/FP applicaitions will run on Java SE Embedded compact1 implementations.  There have been numerous bug fixes and improvements (most notably security fixes) to the APIs as compared to the very dated CDC/FP APIs that might impact application compatibility.</p>

BODY: 
<p>
Arm processors come in all makes and sizes, a certain percentage of 
which address a market where cost, footprint and power requirements are 
at a premium.&nbsp; In this space, the inclusion of even a floating point 
unit would be considered an unnecessary luxury.&nbsp; To perform floating 
point operations with these processors, software emulation is required.</p> 
  <p>Higher-end Arm processors come bundled with additional capability 
that enables hardware execution of floating point operations.&nbsp; The 
difference between these two architectures gave rise to two separate Embedded Application Binary Interfaces or EABIs for ARM: <i>soft float</i> and <i>VFP (Vector Floating Point)</i>.&nbsp; Although there is forward compatibility between soft and hard 
float, there is no backward compatibility.&nbsp; And in fact, when it comes 
to providing binaries for <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">Java SE Embedded for Arm</a>,
 Oracle provides two separate options: a soft float binary and a VFP binary.&nbsp; In the Linux community, 
releases built upon both these EABIs are refereed to as <i>armel</i> based distributions.<br /></p> 
  <p> 
  Enter <i>armhf</i>.&nbsp; Although a big step up in performance, the VFP EABI utilizes 
less-than-optimal argument passing when a floating point operations take
 place.&nbsp; In this scenario, floating point arguments must first be 
passed through integer registers prior to executing in the floating 
point unit.&nbsp; A new EABI, referred to as <i>armhf</i> optimizes the calling convention for floating point operations by passing arguments directly into floating point registers.&nbsp; It furthermore includes a more efficient system call convention.&nbsp; The end result is applications compiled with the <i>armhf</i> standard should demonstrate modest performance improvement in some cases, and significant improvement for floating point intensive applications.</p> 
  <p>Alas, <i>armhf</i> represents yet another binary incompatible standard, but one that has already gained considerable traction in the community. Although still relatively early, the transition from <i>armel</i> to <i>armhf</i> is underway.&nbsp; In fact, <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2012-November/036106.html">Ubuntu has already announced that future releases will only be built to the <i>armhf</i> standard</a>, effectively obsoleting <i>armel</i>. As mentioned in <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/oracle_releases_jdk_for_linux">Henrik's Stahl's Blog</a>, an <i>armhf</i> version of Java SE Embedded is in the works, and we have already made available a <a href="http://jdk8.java.net/fxarmpreview/javafx-arm-developer-preview.html"><i>armhf</i>-based developer Preview of JDK 8 with JavaFX</a>.</p> 
  <p>In the interim, we will have to deal with the incompatibilities between <i>armel</i> and <i>armhf</i>.&nbsp; Most recently we've seen a rash of failed attempts to run the ArmV7 VFP Java SE Embedded binary on top of an <i>armhf</i>-based Linux distro.&nbsp; During diagnosis, the question becomes, how can I determine whether my Linux distribution is based on <i>armel</i> or <i>armhf</i>?&nbsp; Turns out this is not as straightforward as one might think.&nbsp; Aside from experience and anecdotal evidence, one possible way to ascertain whether you're running on <i>armel</i> or <i>armhf</i> is to run the following obscure command: 
  </p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>$ readelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep Tag_ABI_VFP_args</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>If the <tt>Tag_ABI_VFP_args</tt> tag is found, then you're running on an <i>armhf</i> system.&nbsp; If
      nothing is returned, then it's <i>armel</i>.&nbsp; To show you an example, here's what happens on a Raspberry Pi running the <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> distribution:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>pi@raspberrypi:~$ readelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep
        Tag_ABI_VFP_args<br />
        &nbsp; Tag_ABI_VFP_args: VFP registers</tt></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This indicates an <i>armhf</i> distro, which in fact is what Raspbian is.&nbsp; On the original, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">soft-float Debian Wheezy</a> distribution, here's what happens:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>pi@raspberrypi:~$ readelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep
        Tag_ABI_VFP_args</tt> <br /></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Nothing returned indicates that this is indeed <i>armel</i>.</p> 
  <p>Many thanks to the folks participating in <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=20873">this Raspberry Pi forum</a> topic for providing this suggestion.<br /></p>

BODY: 
<p>For the last few years, many of the JavaFX related blog posts found here have made reference to all or parts of a Scoreboard application written in JavaFX.&nbsp; For example, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/a_raspberry_pi_javafx_electronic">the entry prior to this</a> contains a video demonstrating how this Scoreboard application can be run on an embedded device such as a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and displayed on an ordinary flat screen TV.</p> 
  <p>Alongside those posts, some have asked for access to the source code to this application.&nbsp; I've always felt uncomfortable releasing the code, not under the delusion that it has any commercial value, but rather because, let us say, it was not developed with the strictest software engineering standards in mind.&nbsp; Having gotten over those insecurities (not really), I've decided to place it in a <a href="http://home.java.net/">java.net</a> project called <a href="http://java.net/projects/javafx-scoreboard">javafx-scoreboard</a>.</p> 
  <p>If you are interested in gaining access to this code you'll need to do the following:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>Register on <a href="https://java.net/projects">http://home.java.net/projects</a>&nbsp; to get a java.net account.&nbsp; It's free and painless.&nbsp; If you already have an account, terrific! You can skip this step.</li> 
    <li>Send an email to me at <a href="mailto:james.connors@oracle.com">james.connors@oracle.com</a>&nbsp; asking to be added to the <a href="http://java.net/projects/javafx-scoreboard">javafx-scoreboard</a> project.&nbsp; Include your java.net username in the email.</li> 
    <li>Once you're added to the project, you'll have download access to the contents of the project.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>For grins, here's document that gives an <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/javafx-scoreboard/README-v1.1.html">overview of the Scoreboard application</a>.</p>

As evidenced at the recently completed <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a> 2012 conference, community excitement towards the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and its potential as a Java development and deployment platform was readily palpable.&nbsp; Fast forward three months, Oracle has announced the availability of a <a href="http://jdk8.java.net/fxarmpreview/javafx-arm-developer-preview.html">JDK 8 (with JavaFX) for Arm Early Access Developer Preview</a> where the reference platform for this release is none other than the Raspberry Pi.</p> 
  <p>What makes this especially interesting to me is the addition of JavaFX to the Java SE-Embedded 8 platform.&nbsp; It turns out that at $35US, the (not so) humble Raspberry Pi has a very capable graphics processor, opening up a Pandora's box of graphics applications that could be applied to this beloved device.&nbsp; As a first step in becoming familiar with just how this works, I decided to dust off a two year old JavaFX scoreboard application, originally written for a Windows laptop, and see how it would run on the Pi.&nbsp; Low and behold, the application runs unmodified (without even a recompile).</p> 
  <p>The video that follows shows how an ordinary flat screen TV can be converted into a full screen electronic scoreboard driven by a Raspberry Pi.&nbsp; The requirements for such a solution are incredibly straightforward: (1) the TV needs access to a power receptacle and (2) it must be within range of a WiFi network in order to receive scoreboard update packets.&nbsp; The device is so compact and miserly from a power perspective, that we velcro the Pi to the back of the TV and get our power from the TV's USB port. If you can spare a few moments, it just might be worth your while to take a look.<br /></p>

<p>Darn, I just though of exactly the same setup; Pi's to convert big TV's into score displays, with a laptop as the central controller. But I wanted to go the extra mile and record the events as well (scores, player fauls, etc) so you can generate any game information, from score board, 24s clock to score sheet.</p>

TITLE: Sprinkle Some Magik on that Java Virtual Machine

BODY: 
<p>
GE Energy, through its Smallworld subsidiary, has been providing geospatial software solutions to the utility and telco markets for over 20 years.&nbsp; One of the fundamental building blocks of their technology is a dynamically-typed object oriented programming language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magik_%28programming_language%29">Magik</a>.&nbsp; Like Java, Magik source code is compiled down to bytecodes that run on a virtual machine -- in this case the Magik Virtual Machine.</p> 
  <p>Throughout the years, GE has invested considerable engineering talent in
 the support and maintenance of this virtual machine.&nbsp; At the same time 
vast energy and resources have been invested in the Java Virtual 
Machine. The question for GE has been whether to continue to make that 
investment on its own or to leverage massive effort provided by the Java 
community? Utilizing the Java Virtual Machine instead of maintaining its
 own virtual machine would give GE more opportunity to focus on 
application solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>At last count, there are dozens, perhaps hundreds of examples of programming languages that have been hosted atop the Java Virtual Machine.&nbsp; Prior to the release of Java 7, that effort, although certainly possible, was generally less than optimal for languages like Magik because of its dynamic nature.&nbsp; Java, as a statically typed language had little use for this capability.&nbsp; In the quest to be a more universal virtual machine, Java 7, via <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292">JSR-292</a>, introduced a new bytecode called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">invokedynamic</font>.&nbsp; In short, <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">invokedynamic</font> affords a more flexible method call mechanism needed by dynamic languages like Magik.</p> 
  <p>With this new capability GE Energy has succeeded in hosting their Magik environment on top of the Java Virtual Machine.&nbsp; So you may ask, why would GE wish to do such a thing?&nbsp; The benefits are many:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Competitors to GE Energy claimed that the Magik environment was proprietary.&nbsp; By utilizing the Java Virtual Machine, that argument gets put to bed.&nbsp; JVM development is done in <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">open source</a>, where contributions are made world-wide by all types of organizations and individuals.<br /></li> 
    <li>The unprecedented wealth of class libraries and applications written for
 the Java platform are now opened up to Magik/JVM platform as first
 class citizens.</li> 
    <li>In addition, the Magik/JVM solution vastly increases the developer pool to include the 9 million Java developers -- the largest developer community on the planet.<br /></li> 
    <li>Applications running on the JVM showed substantial performance gains, in some cases as much as a 5x speed up over the original Magik platform.<br /></li> 
    <li>Legacy Magik applications can still run on the original platform.&nbsp; They can be seamlessly migrated to run on the JVM by simply recompiling the source code.<br /></li> 
    <li>GE can now leverage the huge Java community.&nbsp; Undeniably the best virtual machine ever created, hundreds if not thousands of world class developers continually improve, poke, prod and scrutinize all aspects of the Java platform.&nbsp; As enhancements are made, GE automatically gains access to these.<br /></li> 
    <li>As Magik has little in the way of support for multi-threading, GE will benefit from current and future Java offerings (e.g. <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/">lambda expressions</a>) that aim to further facilitate multi-core/multi-threaded application development.<br /></li> 
    <li>As the JVM is available for many more platforms, it broadens the reach of Magik, including the potential to run on a class devices never envisioned just a few short years ago.&nbsp; For example, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">Java SE compatible runtime environments are available for popular embedded ARM/Intel/PowerPC configurations</a> that could theoretically host this software too.<br /></li> 
  </ul>As compared to other JVM language projects, the Magik integration differs in that it represents a serious commercial entity betting a sizable part of its business on the success of this effort.&nbsp; Expect to see announcements not only from General Electric, but other organizations as they realize the benefits of utilizing the Java Virtual Machine.<br />

<p>So basically their software runs faster and on more platforms. Their VM development is done by someone else for free. They even get additional features (multi-threading) for free. Doesn't sound altruistic for me.<br/>
Now let's hope they also contribute to the JVM.</p>

<p>Yes - they very much do contribute to the JVM. I have been working with this team (last week - sob - after 18 fabulous months) and they/we contribute via the mail list, bug submission and to the conferences. Also, work on JVM-8/Mac testing. I personally have written up a lot of what has been learned about high speed JNI (which is used a lot to talk to pre-existing database and geometry libraries) and intend to continue to write up more.</p>

<p>This is a very good move for GE.  The Magik programming language is very similar to Java, syntax differences aside, and although Magik is predominantly interpretted (rather than compiled) which is good for debugging and rapid development, it is inherently slower than a compiled solution - like Java.</p>


<p>If GE can indeed take Magik code and compile it up into Java, then that's a very cool way to get into speeding up processing, multi-threading, and making things a lot more portable.  Kudos.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>The compiler does not convert Magik to Java. It compiles Magik to bytecode. The performance benefits you suggest are available though. The biggest challenge in achieving high performance form a dynamic dispatch language like Magik on the JVM is to ensure that call sites do not become mega morphic and then when they do the dispatch code is as fast as possible.</p>

<p>I hope GE will go on the way to finally support its Smallworld products on JAVA technology and let Magik just for legacy concerns. <br/>
It's a benefit for companies looking for professionals because no one knows about Magik, but there is a lot of experts and professionals working on JAVA everywhere. <br/>
It's a benefit for programmers because instead of learning a weird technology like Magik no used anywhere except for Smallworld, they can improve their curriculum with a JAVA technology widely recognized and in demand.</p>

<p>I've been using Magik for over 20 years, never had to complain about it. Great language. Shame it wasnt made public earlier, as it would probably have caught like Java, Python or Ruby did.<br/>
It is indeed closer to Python and Ruby than it is to Java. Now it is strange to me hearing that Magik is interpreted. Magik is  compiled into pseudo-code, just like Java is, and also works on a (Magik) virtual machine.<br/>
The interactive Magik terminal compiles (just in time) and executes code. Code then resides in memory as VM code, not as original Magik language. Hence the distinction with an interpreted language. <br/>
Now yes, the port to JVM will allow simpler integration of existing Java capabilities into existing Magik apps. <br/>
But Magik will definitely stay an interesting language for those who know it.<br/>
The downside is for old Magik programmers who will no more have an edge with this special rare skill. But I suppose that's the way it goes :)</p>

<p>I too have been a Magik developer for over 20 years and I am delighted by this development as it will open the way for Smallworld to be deployed on as many platforms as supported by the JVM. But I am always taken aback by references to Magik programmers having an edge with special rare skills. A programming language is just a set of instructions and once you know one well, learning another is relatively straight forward. The actual rare and special skill is the knowledge of Smallworld libraries and specific domain knowledge be that Telco, Utility, Landbase, etc. So don't expect a sudden rush of great Smallworld programers coming from the Java community. They will come but they will have to do their internship like the rest of us.</p>

<p>Like another user said in this forum, Magik can stay just for legacy purpose, but GE should move to 21 century and perform a full integration with JAVA, not only the JVM but the language and framework as well.<br/>

One of the more exciting developments in the embedded systems world has been the announcement and availability of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, a very capable computer that is no bigger than a credit card.&nbsp; At $35 US, initial demand for the device was so significant, that very long back orders quickly ensued. After months of patiently waiting, mine finally arrived.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p><img width="604" height="403" src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi.jpg" /></p> 
  <p>Those initial growing pains appear to have been fixed, so availability now should be much more reasonable. At a very high level, here are some of the important specs:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Broadcom BCM2835 System on a chip (SoC)</li> 
    <li>ARM1176JZFS, with 
floating point, running at 700MHz</li> 
    <li>Videocore 4 GPU capable of BluRay quality playback</li> 
    <li>256Mb RAM</li> 
    <li>2 USB ports and Ethernet</li> 
    <li>Boots from SD card</li> 
    <li>Linux distributions (e.g. Debian) available</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> So what's taking place taking place with respect to the Java platform and Raspberry Pi?</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>A Java SE Embedded binary suitable for the Raspberry Pi is available for download (Arm v6/7) <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">here</a>.&nbsp; Note, this is based on the <i>armel</i> architecture, a variety of Arm designed to support floating point through a compatibility library that operates on more platforms, but can hamper performance.&nbsp; In order to use this Java SE binary, select the available <a href="http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/images/debian/7/2012-08-08-wheezy-armel/2012-08-08-wheezy-armel.zip">Debian distribution for your Raspberry Pi</a>.</li> 
    <li>The more recent <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian distribution</a> is based on the <i>armhf</i> (hard float) architecture, which provides for more efficient hardware-based floating point operations.&nbsp; However armhf is not binary compatible with armel.&nbsp; As of the writing of this blog, Java SE Embedded binaries are not yet publicly available for the armhf-based Raspbian distro, but as mentioned in <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/oracle_releases_jdk_for_linux">Henrik Stahl's blog</a>, an armhf release is in the works.</li> 
    <li>As demonstrated at the just-completed <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne 2012 San Francisco</a> event, the graphics processing unit inside the Raspberry Pi is very capable indeed, and makes for an excellent candidate for JavaFX.&nbsp; As such, plans also call for a Pi-optimized version of JavaFX in a future release too.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ol> </ol>A thriving community around the Raspberry Pi has developed at light speed, and as evidenced by the packed attendance at Pi-specific sessions at Java One 2012, the interest in Java for this platform is following suit. So stay tuned for more developments...<br />

<p>As evidenced by the attention given at the just-completed Java One 2012 event in San Francisco, Java for embedded devices is something Oracle deeply cares about, and the mobile platforms you refer to (iOS, Android and Windows) represent one (albeit very, very important) market.  With this software, Oracle is aiming at the burgeoning M2M space, where the aforementioned platforms aren't major players (yet?).</p>


<p>But your point is well taken.  The current decision not to make JavaFX available on mobile platforms was made at levels way above my pay grade, where factors unknown to us have to be considered.</p>


<p>If you feel strongly about this, I suggest you and others who share your beliefs, make your opinion known in as public a manner as possible as frequently as possible. </p>

<p>From a Java perspective, my (not so) educated guess is that performance might improve slightly for a majority of cases.  Perhaps we'll see some performance gain from the fact that (1) the JVM will be compiled with a newer and better optimizing compiler and (2) more platform specific (less generic) compiler options might be utilized to build the JVM.</p>


<p>One would expect floating point intensive Java applications to improve markedly.  Additionally function/method calling conventions have improved under armhf.  So if you have an application that does a large amount of method calling proportionally, performance might improve nicely there too.</p>


<p>As soon as an armhf JVM become publicly available, I intend on comparing armel and armhf versions and publishing to this blog.  My guess is the results that will again draw the most attention will be the comparison between Java SE-E and OpenJDK </p>

<p>Oracle's embedded Java license is a major hinderance. It states that a device used as a general computation machine doesn't require a license.</p>


<p>RaspberryPi can be used as a general computation device, but it's physical size leads it to embedded applications, which requires a license from Oracle. Oracle's license is designed so you have to negotiate with Oracle, and likely, they're going to want a per device fee. Honestly, this whole thing scares me (dealing with lawyers and salesmen) so I'd probably choose to just develop in Ruby or Python, which is already widely accepted on the device.</p>


<p>If Oracle wants a foothold with Java on this device, they need to rethink their 1990's microsoft-esk strategy.</p>

<p>The open source OpenJDK version is available for these platforms too, which you are free to use.  Even with this option, many organizations will still opt for the commercial version of Java SE-Embedded.  Why?  Among many reasons, it is simply better and is formally supported. </p>

<p>Thank you for the response Jim. I would agree that would/could/should be a viable option, but your own benchmarks show that Oracle's proprietary JDK is far superior to vanilla OpenJDK builds. If everything else was equal, and I had the _option_ to buy support from Oracle, I would have a different view point and would probably be advocating rather than admonishing the use of Java on the device.</p>


<p>So I stand by my original point: I don't think Java will be relavent on this device without a free, less restrictive, and performant implementation when the F/OSS alternatives are 'just as fast' as the vanilla OpenJDK builds.<br/>
Even a simple policy change like: &quot;Are you building less that 5,000 devices a year? Claim your free Java license online right now!&quot; would start to open doors for Oracle.</p>

<p>After successful runs at Java One 2011 San Francisco and Tokyo, The Java SE Embedded Hands On Lab returns for Java One 2012.&nbsp; If you're attending the Java One event in San Francisco (Sept 30 - Oct 4), please consider signing up for this session.&nbsp; As an added incentive, we will be raffling off a couple of the Plug Computer devices that you'll gain experience with during this lab.&nbsp; Seating is limited to 100 students, so register early.<br /></p> 
  <p>Here's an overview:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>This hands-on lab aims to show that developers already familiar with the
 Java develop/debug/deploy lifecycle can apply those same skills to 
develop Java applications, using Java SE Embedded, on embedded devices. 
The participants in the lab will:</i></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
    <ul> 
      <li><i>Have their own individual embedded device so they can gain valuable 
hands-on experience</i></li> 
      <li><i>Turn their embedded device into a web container, using off-the-shelf software</i></li> 
      <li><i> Learn how to deploy embedded Java applications, developed with an IDE, onto their device</i></li> 
      <li><i>Learn how embedded Java applications can be remotely debugged from their desktop IDE</i></li> 
      <li><i>Learn how to remotely monitor and manage embedded Java applications from their desktop</i></li> 
    </ul> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The course description can be found here:<br /><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7889">HOL 7889: Java SE Embedded Development Made Easy </a><br /></p> 
  <p><img src="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/javaone-2012/j1embedded.gif" /> </p> 
  <p>In addition, 2012 marks the first year that we will have a venue specifically tailored for the Java embedded community.&nbsp; Entitled <i><b>Java Embedded @ Java One</b></i>,&nbsp; this event takes place during the JavaOne/OpenWorld week in San Francisco on October 3-4.&nbsp; To Quote from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/embedded/index.html">Java Embedded @ Java One URL</a>:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>The conference will feature dedicated business-focused content from 
Oracle discussing how Java Embedded delivers a secure, optimized 
environment ideal for multiple network-based devices, as well as 
meaningful industry-focused sessions from peers who are already 
successfully utilizing Java Embedded.</i></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>So if you want to participate in what many consider to be the next big trend in computing -- the internet of things -- come join us 10/3-4 in San Francisco.<br /></p>

<p>Like many of you, I learn best by getting my hands dirty.&nbsp; When confronted with the task of understanding a new set of products and technologies and figuring out how they might apply to a vertical industry like healthcare, I set out to create a demonstration.&nbsp; The video that follows aims to show how the Oracle embedded software portfolio can be applied to a healthcare application.&nbsp; The demonstration utilizes among others, Java SE Embedded, Berkeley DB, Apache Tomcat, Oracle 11gR2 and Oracle Database Mobile Server.</p> 
  <p>Eric Jensen gives a great critique and description of the demo <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/mobile_and_embedded/entry/enabling_m2m_in_healthcare_with">here</a>.&nbsp; To sum it up, we aim to show how live medical data can be collected on a medical device, stored in a local database, synchronized to a master database and furthermore propagated to a mobile phone (Android) application.&nbsp; Come take a look!<br /></p>

TITLE: Take Two: Comparing JVMs on ARM/Linux
DATE: 03/19/2012 18:52:12

BODY: 
<p>Although the intent of the previous article, entitled <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/comparing_jvms_on_arm_linux">Comparing JVMs on ARM/Linux</a>, was to introduce and highlight the availability of the HotSpot server compiler (referred to as <i>c2)</i> for Java SE-Embedded ARM v7,&nbsp; it seems, based on feedback, that everyone was more interested in the OpenJDK comparisons to Java SE-E.&nbsp; But there were two main concerns:<br /></p> 
  <ol> </ol> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The fact that the previous article compared Java SE-E 7 against OpenJDK 6 might be construed as an unlevel playing field because version 7 is newer and therefore potentially more optimized.</li> 
    <li>That the generic compiler settings chosen to build the OpenJDK implementations did not put those versions in a particularly favorable light.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ol> </ol> 
  <p>With those considerations in mind, we'll institute the following changes to this version of the benchmarking:<br /></p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>In order to help alleviate an additional concern that there is some sort of benchmark bias, we'll use a different suite, called DaCapo.&nbsp; Funded and supported by many prestigious organizations, DaCapo's aim is to benchmark real world applications.&nbsp; Further information about DaCapo can be found at <a href="http://dacapobench.org">http://dacapobench.org</a>.</li> 
    <li>At the suggestion of Xerxes Ranby, who has been a great help through this entire exercise, a newer Linux distribution will be used to assure that the OpenJDK implementations were built with more optimal compiler settings.&nbsp; The Linux distribution in this instance is Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot.</li> 
    <li>Having experienced difficulties getting Ubuntu 11.10 to run on the original D2Plug ARMv7 platform, for these benchmarks, we'll switch to an embedded system that has a supported Ubuntu 11.10 release.&nbsp; That platform is the <a href="http://www.freescale.com/">Freescale i.MX53 Quick Start Board</a>.&nbsp; It has an ARMv7 Coretex-A8 processor running at 1GHz with 1GB RAM.</li> 
    <li>We'll limit comparisons to 4 JVM implementations:</li> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Java SE-E 7 Update 2 c1 compiler (default)<br /></li> 
      <li>Java SE-E 6 Update 30 (c1 compiler is the only option)<br /></li> 
      <li>OpenJDK 6 IcedTea6 1.11pre 6b23~pre11-0ubuntu1.11.10.2 CACAO build 1.1.0pre2</li> 
      <li>OpenJDK 6 IcedTea6 1.11pre 6b23~pre11-0ubuntu1.11.10.2 JamVM build-1.6.0-devel</li> 
    </ul> 
  </ol> 
  <p>
  Certain OpenJDK implementations were eliminated from this round of testing for the simple reason that their performance was not competitive.&nbsp; The Java SE 7u2 c2 compiler was also removed because although quite respectable, it did not perform as well as the c1 compilers.&nbsp; Recall that c2 works optimally in long-lived situations.&nbsp; Many of these benchmarks completed in a relatively short period of time.&nbsp; To get a feel for where c2 shines, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/comparing_jvms_on_arm_linux">take a look at the first chart in this blog</a>.<br /></p> 
  <p>The first chart that follows includes performance of all benchmark runs on all platforms.&nbsp; Later on we'll look more at individual tests.&nbsp; In all runs, smaller means faster.&nbsp; The DaCapo aficionado may notice that only 10 of the 14 DaCapo tests for this version were executed.&nbsp; The reason for this is that these 10 tests represent the only ones successfully completed by all 4 JVMs.&nbsp; Only the Java SE-E 6u30 could successfully run all of the tests.&nbsp; Both OpenJDK instances not only failed to complete certain tests, but also experienced VM aborts too.<br /></p>

  <p>One of the first observations that can be made between Java SE-E 6 and 7 is that, for all intents and purposes, they are on par with regards to performance.&nbsp; While it is a fact that successive Java SE releases add additional optimizations, it is also true that Java SE 7 introduces additional complexity to the Java platform thus balancing out any potential performance gains at this point.&nbsp; We are still early into Java SE 7.&nbsp; We would expect further performance enhancements for Java SE-E 7 in future updates.</p>

  <p>So it looks like OpenJDK results are mixed for this round of benchmarks.&nbsp; In some cases, performance looks to have improved.&nbsp; But in a majority of instances, OpenJDK still lags behind Java SE-Embedded considerably.<br /></p> 
  <p>Time to put on my asbestos suit.&nbsp; Let the flames begin...<br /></p>

<p>No flames here, thanks for the comparison. The more JVMs we have, the more Oracle will be forced to keep performance as a priority in HotSpot. :)</p>

<p>Of course its worth noting that all three working ARM variants of OpenJDK + Zero are left out in the above test:</p>


<p>1. The optimized interpreter + Thumb2 JIT Zero *mixed mode* jvm that performed the best of the openjdk variants in the last study. ( icedtea6-1.11.1 )<br/>

2. The assembler-optimized Zero *interpreted mode* ( also found in icedtea6-1.11.1 -Xint ) this one was also included in the last study.<br/>

3. The pure c++ Zero interpreter from OpenJDK upstream &lt;- the zero variant shipped in oneiric, i can understand that you left this one out of this study above.</p>


<p>Nice to see the some big speedup especially for CACAO when switching from Debian armel armv4+ to Ubuntu armel armv7 thumb2 tuning.</p>


<p>Please note that in the next Ubuntu 12.04 long term support release, targeting servers, the userspace EABI have switched from the armel &quot;softfp&quot; to armhf &quot;hard&quot; for extra performance. All OpenJDK JVM variants, JamVM, CACAO and Zero have been updated to support this armhf EABI hard in order to be ready to best serve the ARM server market.</p>

<p>The blog states that certain OpenJDK implementations were left out because they were not competitive.  When running the DaCapo benchmark on these OpenJDK + Zero variants, performance was 5x slower (and sometimes worse) than the Java SE-E versions.  I was trying to be nice by including only the best of the OpenJDK variants.  </p>

<p>I tried to run the latest Embedded Java SE 7u4 on my Pandaboard running Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS but so far I couldn't get it working.</p>


<p>The first problem was the hardcoded library path &quot;/lib/ld-linux.so.3&quot;.<br/>
I switched to /lib and ran the following command to fix that issue:<br/>
sudo ln -s arm-linux-gnueabihf/ld-2.15.so ld-linux.so.3</p>


<p>The other libs where found but it still doesn't work.<br/>
Installation details and my attempts to get it working can be found here:<br/>

<p>Any ideas? Linux Kernel 3.2.0 issue?</p>

<p>J.U., Ubuntu 12.04 uses the new hard-float ABI (aka armhf or gnueabihf), whereas 7u4 only supports the soft-float ABI (aka armel or gnueabi). You need to remove the symlink you created and install the soft-float libc and gcc support libraries:</p>


<p>sudo apt-get install -y libc6-armel libsfgcc1</p>

<p>Hello Trevor,</p>


<p>many thanks I'll try that.<br/>
Still it would be great if the next Embedded Java (7u5+) would support the hard-float ABI (armhf) as this will speed things up even more.</p>

For quite some time, Java Standard Edition releases have included both client and server bytecode compilers (referred to as <i>c1</i> and <i>c2</i> respectively), whereas Java SE-Embedded binaries only contained the client c1 compiler.&nbsp; The rationale for excluding c2 stems from the fact that (1) eliminating optional components saves space, where in the embedded world, space is at a premium, and (2) embedded platforms were not given serious consideration for handling server-like workloads.&nbsp; But all that is about to change.&nbsp; In anticipation of the ARM processor's legitimate entrance into the server market (<a href="http://www.calxeda.com/">see Calxeda</a>), Oracle has, with the latest update of Java SE-Embedded (7u2), <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">made the c2 compiler available for ARMv7/Linux platforms</a>, further enhancing performance for a large class of traditional server applications.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>These two compilers go about their business in different ways.&nbsp; Of the two, c1 is a lighter optimizing compiler, but has faster start up.&nbsp; It delivers excellent performance and as the default bytecode compiler, works extremely well in almost all situations.&nbsp; Compared to c1, c2 is the more aggressive optimizer and is suited for long-lived java processes.&nbsp; Although slower at start up, it can be shown to achieve better performance over time.&nbsp; As a case in point, take a look at the graph that follows.</p>

  <p>One of the most popular Java-based applications, Apache Tomcat, was installed on an ARMv7/Linux device.&nbsp;&nbsp; The chart shows the relative performance, as defined by mean HTTP request time, of the Tomcat server run with the c1 client compiler (red line) and the c2 server compiler (blue line).&nbsp; The HTTP request load was generated by an external system on a dedicated network utilizing the <i>ab</i> (Apache Bench) program.&nbsp; The closer the response time is to zero the better, you can see that for the initial run of 25,000 HTTP requests, the c1 compiler produces faster average response times than c2.&nbsp; It takes time for the c2 compiler to &quot;warm up&quot;, but once the threshold of 50,000 or so requests is met, the c2 compiler performance is superior to c1.&nbsp; At 250,000 HTTP requests, mean response time for the c2-based Tomcat server instance is 14% faster than its c1 counterpart.<br /></p> 
  <p>It is important to realize that c2 assumes, and indeed requires more resources (i.e. memory).&nbsp; Our sample device with 1GB RAM, was more than adequate for these rounds of tests.&nbsp; Of course your mileage may vary, but if you have the right hardware and the right workload, give c2 a further look.</p> 
  <p>While discussing these results with a few of my compadres, it was suggested that OpenJDK and some of its variants be included in on this comparison.&nbsp; The following chart shows mean http request times for 6 different configurations:</p>

  <p>Results remain pretty much unchanged, so only the first 4 runs (25K-100K requests) are shown.&nbsp; As can be seen, The Java SE-E VMs are on the order of 3-5x faster than their OpenJDK counterparts irrespective of the bytecode compiler chosen.&nbsp; One additional promising VM called <i>shark</i> was not included in these tests because, although it built from source successfully, it failed to run Apache Tomcat.&nbsp; In defense of shark, the ARM version may still be in development (i.e. non-stable) mode.<br /></p> 
  <p>Creating a really fast virtual machine is hard work and takes a lot of time to perfect.&nbsp; Considering the resources expended by Oracle (and formerly Sun), it is no surprise that the commercial Java SE VMs are excellent performers.&nbsp; But the extent to which they outperform their OpenJDK counterparts is surprising.&nbsp; It would be no shock if someone in the know could demonstrate better OpenJDK results.&nbsp; But herein lies one considerable problem:&nbsp; it is an exercise in patience and perseverance just to locate and build a proper OpenJDK platform suitable for a particular CPU/Linux configuration.&nbsp; No offense would be taken if corrections were presented, and a straightforward mechanism to support these OpenJDK builds were provided.<br /></p>

<p>Thank you an introduction to the ARM OpenJDK JVM porting work.</p>


<p>The OpenJDK Zero *mixed-mode* JVM used in this compare includes the now re-maintained ARM Thumb2 JIT and assembler interpreter port that got re-introduced in the IcedTea6-1.11 release. <br/>
Many of the OpenJDK JVM like CACAO and JamVM are by design tuned for embedded and client use and thus show strength in both low memory overhead and fast startup time.</p>


<p>When testing JVM performance on ARM its important to remember that the default optimization settings used by the compilers to build the JVM do matter.</p>


<p>The Debian 6.0.4 squeeze &quot;armel&quot; distribution use ARMv4t optimization by default. This low optimization level enable the Debian built packages run on as many kind of different ARM broads and CPU's as possible. The trade-off are that you basically disable all VFP, floating point, optimizations and make synchronization code slower by forcing the JVM to call the Linux kernel helper instead of using faster ARMv7 atomic instructions directly.</p>


<p>To give OpenJDK JVM a better match i would suggest re-running the benchmark using OpenJDK built on top of Debian wheezy &quot;armhf&quot; that by default optimize for the ARMv7 thumb2 instruction-set and make use of the VFP unit inside the CPU, also the &quot;armhf&quot; ABI allows better argument passing between library functions inside the VFP registers of the CPU. Two OpenJDK JVM that are already updated to support this new &quot;armhf&quot; ABI are JamVM and Zero.</p>


<p>You could also run a benchmark using OpenJDK JVMs built using the Ubuntu Precise &quot;armel&quot; tool-chains that still use the legacy soft-float ABI while still adding ARMv7 Thumb2 and VFP optimizations. All OpenJDK JVM tested in this compare would run better by simply using a higher optimization level during the build.</p>

The trade-off are that you basically disable all VFP, floating point, optimizations and make synchronization code slower by forcing the JVM to call the Linux kernel helper instead of using faster ARMv7 atomic instructions directly.</p>

<p>You're comparing 6 (CACAO, JamVM, Zero) against 7 for the proprietary ARM port.  That doesn't seem like a fair comparison to me.</p>

<p>Fair Enough.  I would have liked to use OpenJDK 7 but didn't have a whole lot of luck building a stable platform.  So stay tuned, I'll include Java SE-Embedded 6 as a comparison in a future blog.</p>

<p>Once Android introduced a JIT compiler into their release, we started looking at performance.  The last comparison was done by Bob Vandette against Android 2.2: <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/javaseembedded/entry/how_does_android_22s_performance_stack_up_against_java_se_embedded." rel="nofollow">https://blogs.oracle.com/javaseembedded/entry/how_does_android_22s_performance_stack_up_against_java_se_embedded.</a>  Bottom line:  Java SE-E is more than 2x better.  With the continued Oracle/Google Java lawsuit, my guess is we won't be publishing any further comparisons any time soon.</p>

<p>So... OpenJDK is not as fast as it could be... It explains the Oracle's complaints with Apache and the TCKs. Nice! good to know my company do the right thing switching to Python a year ago, where development is transparent, without burocracy or business interfering.</p>

<p>I cant understand why people in oracle are so stupid to kill their own baby. People who research on languages if they stumble upon this page, with all those smart alec prose, would not only not 'buy' oracle jvm for ARM, but also stop considering java altogether. And theres a comment from a python troll too. Great! Oracle is systematically killing java.</p>

<p>The OpenJDK Zero *mixed-mode* JVM used in this compare includes the now re-maintained ARM Thumb2 JIT and assembler interpreter port that got re-introduced in the IcedTea6-1.11 release. <br/>
Some of the OpenJDK JVM like CACAO and JamVM are by design tuned for embedded and client use and thus show strength in both low memory overhead and fast startup time.</p>

Cubieboard2 is an A20 dual core cortex-A7 board with proper ethernet and more ram (1GB) than a raspberry pi.<br/>
It's nearly twice the cost though.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I got a bit confused about HW requirments of c2 (server) optimized apps.<br/>
I built a jre with jrecreate tool using the default arguments. the generated log shows that the target platforme is ARMv6. On the other hand c2 require ARMv7.</p>


<p>Our application is a long running server so will benifit from c2 optimizations when running on our target IMX6 (ARMv7). Now the question is, will the app built with c2 work using the jre built for ARMv6 on top of the ARMv7 hardware?</p>


<p>thnx.</p>

<p>Hi Malek,</p>


<p>The c2-generated JRE should work on your iMX6 system. To demonstrate, this is what I did.</p>


<p>First: generate c2-based JRE from 1.8.0_33 eJDK:<br/>
$ jrecreate.sh --dest jre1.8.0_33-c2 --vm server</p>


<p>tar up the generated JRE<br/>
$ tar cvfz jre1.8.0_33-c2.tar.gz jre1.8.0_33-c2</p>


<p>Copy c2 JRE over to an ARMv6 system.  In this instance, we'll use a Raspberry Pi.</p>


<p>pi@pi0 ~ $ ./jre1.8.0_33-c2/bin/java -version<br/>
Error occurred during initialization of VM<br/>
Server VM is only supported on ARMv7+ VFP</p>


<p>Copy c2 JRE over to iMX6 based system (Boundary Devices BD-SL-i.MX6)</p>


<p>jimc@imx6-armhf:~$ ./jre1.8.0_33-c2/bin/java -version<br/>

<p>Thanks for this blog entry and the video. I missed your &quot;The Unofficial Java SE Embedded SDK&quot; before and I think there is a lot of potential for micro servers and clusters. The trick would be to find an efficient and  inexpensive way (in terms of power, size and costs) to get a database in one or several of the nodes.</p>

<p>
Now that the dust has settled, sincere thanks go out to my compadres (you know who you are) for helping make The Java One 2011 Java SE Embedded Hands on Lab such a success.&nbsp; In fact it was so well received, our peers in Asia are already planning on replicating the effort for JavaOne Tokyo in April 2012.&nbsp; In addition to the Tokyo event,&nbsp; we hope to provide future opportunities for this venue elsewhere.&nbsp; In the interim, we'd seriously consider hosting this lab, albeit on a smaller scale (Java One had 105 networked devices and workstations), for interested customers.&nbsp; To give you a feel for the lab contents, here's a synopsis:</p> 
  <p><i>Java One 2011 Hands on Lab 24642: Java SE Embedded Development Made Easy
<br /><br />This Hands-on Lab aims to show that developers already familiar with the 
Java develop/debug/deploy lifecycle can apply those same skills to 
develop Java applications, using Java SE Embedded, on embedded devices.&nbsp; 
Each participant in the lab will:
</i> <i><br /></i></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><i>Have their own individual embedded device to gain valuable hands on 
experience
</i></li> 
    <li><i>Turn their embedded device into a Java Servlet container
</i></li> 
    <li><i>Learn how to deploy embedded Java applications, developed with the 
NetBeans IDE, onto their device
</i></li> 
    <li><i>Learn how embedded Java applications can be remotely debugged from 
their desktop NetBeans IDE
</i></li> 
    <li><i>Learn how to remotely monitor and manage embedded Java applications 
from their desktop</i></li> 
  </ul>If the logistics for setting up a lab prove to be a bit too much, as an alternative, we've given quite a few live presentations/demonstrations with similar flair.&nbsp; So please, by all means, contact me at <a href="mailto:james.connors@oracle.com">james.connors@oracle.com</a>, if you're interested in learning more.&nbsp; For those of you who run developer user groups, most notably Java User Groups, and are looking for a speaker at your next meeting, please consider us.&nbsp; We will not disappoint.<br />

PRIMARY CATEGORY: Sun

ALLOW COMMENTS: 1

BODY: 
<p>The need to communicate with devices connected to serial ports is a common application requirement.&nbsp; Falling outside the purview of the Java SE platform, serial and parallel port communication has been addressed with a project called <a href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">RXTX</a>.&nbsp; (In the past, you may have known this as javacomm).&nbsp; With RXTX,&nbsp; Java developers access serial ports through the RXTXcomm.jar file.&nbsp; Alongside this jar file, an underlying native layer must be provided to interface with the operating system's UART ports.&nbsp; For the usual suspects (Windows, Linux/x86, MacOS, Solaris/Sparc), pre-compiled binaries are readily available.&nbsp; To host this on an alternative platform, some (hopefully minimal) amount of work is required.</p> 
  <p>Here's hoping the following notes/observations might aid in helping you to build RXTX for an embedded device utilizing one of our <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/overview/javase/index.html">Java SE Embedded</a> binaries.&nbsp; The device used for this particular implementation is my current favorite: the <a href="http://www.plugcomputer.org/">Plug Computer</a>.</p> 
  <p>Notes on Getting RX/TX 2.1-7-r2 Working on a Plug Computer<br /><br />1. At this early juncture with Java 7, be wary of mixing Java 7 with code from older versions of Java. The class files generated by the JDK7 javac compiler contain an updated version byte with a value that results in older (Java 6 and before) JVMs refusing to load these classes.<br /><br />2. The RXTX download location <a href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download">http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download</a> has binaries for many platforms including Arm variants, but none that worked for the Plug Computer, so one had to be built from source.<br /><br />3. Using the native GCC for the Plug Computer and the RXTX source, binaries (native shared objects) were compiled for the armv5tel-unknown-linux-gnu platform.<br /><br />4. The RXTX &quot;stable&quot; source code found at the aforementioned site is based on version rxtx 2.1-7r2.&nbsp; This code appears to be pretty long in the tooth, in that it has no knowledge of Java 6.&nbsp; Some changes need to be made to accommodate a JDK 6 environment.&nbsp; Without these modifications, RXTX will not build with JDK6<br /><br />SUGGESTED FIX, most elegant, not recommended:<br />Edit the configure.in file in the source directory and look for the following:<br /></p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case $JAVA_VERSION in
    1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*)
</pre> 
  <p>and change the second line to:<br /></p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*|1.6*)
</pre> 
  <p>Upon modification, the autogen.sh script found in the rxtx source directory must be re-run to recreate the ./configure script.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this requires loading the autoconf, automake and libtool packages (plus dependencies) and ended up resulting in libtool incompatibilies when running the resultant ./configure script.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FIX:<br />Instead, edit ./configure and search for the occurrences (there are more than one) of<br /></p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case $JAVA_VERSION in
    1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*)
</pre> 
  <p>and change the second line to:<br /></p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*|1.6*)
</pre> 
  <p>Run './configure', then 'make' to generate the RXTXcomm.jar and platform specific .so shared object libraries.<br /><br />5. You may also notice in the output of the make, that there were compilation errors for source files which failed to find the meaning of &quot;UTS_RELEASE&quot;.&nbsp; This results in some of the shared object files not being created.&nbsp; These pertain to the non-serial aspects of RXTX.&nbsp; As we were only interested in librxtxSerial.so, this was no problem for us.<br /><br />6. Once built, move the following files into the following directories:<br /></p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # cd rxtx-2.1-7-r2/
    # cp RXTXcomm.jar $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext
    # cd armv5tel-unknown-linux-gnu/.libs/
    # cp librxtxSerial-2.1-7.so $JAVA_HOME/lib/arm
    # cd $JAVA_HOME/lib/arm
    # ln -s librxtxSerial-2.1-7.so librxtxSerial.so
</pre> 
  <p>Now Java applications which utilize RXTX should run without any java command-line additions.</p> 
  <p> The RXTXcomm.jar file can be downloaded <a href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/ToyBox/2.1-7-build1/RXTXcomm.jar">here</a>.&nbsp; To spare you the effort, a few pre-built versions of&nbsp;  <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>librxtxSerial-2.1-7.so are provided at this location:</p>

I have tried the librxtxSerial-2.1-7.so for ARMv6l based systems (e.g. Raspberry Pi), on my Raspberry Pi running OpenJDK 1.6 on Arch Linux</p>


<p>Unfortunately, I don't believe it has the fix.  I get &quot;java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver.nativeGetVersion()Ljava/lang/String; thrown while loading gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver&quot; which would be the message I believe if the  .so did not have the fix.</p>

<p>Your problem may lie in the fact that the Raspberry Pi Arch Linux distro uses the armhf (hard float) ABI which is incompatible with the armel-based version of the librxtxSerial.so which was originally provided here.  I've been patiently waiting and just received my very own Raspberry Pi.  When I get a chance, I'll try compiling an armhf version under the Raspbian (armhf) distro.</p>

<p>Running RXTX as an OSGi bundle allows to dynamically choosing the right native lib to load based on system properties (see OSGi &quot;Bundle-NativeCode&quot; manifest tag).</p>


<p>Unfortunately, running the Oracle JVM 1.7.0 does not allow to distinguish the version of the ARM processor (V.5/6/7) using the system propertie. The &quot;os.arch&quot; is just &quot;arm&quot;. Also, for ARMv6 (Raspberry Pi), it should be possible to distinguish between HF and SF. </p>

Script to JavaFX 2.0</span></b><b><span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%;"><i><br /></i></span></b></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Introduction</b></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">Having been available for a few years now, there is a decent
body of work written for JavaFX using the JavaFX Script language.<span> </span>With the general availability announcement of JavaFX 2.0 Beta, the natural question arises about
converting the legacy code over to the new JavaFX 2.0 platform.<span> </span>This article reflects
on some of the observations encountered while porting source code over from
JavaFX Script to the new JavaFX API paradigm.<span></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Application</b></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">The program chosen for migration is an implementation of the
Sudoku game and serves as a reference application for the book <i>JavaFX – Developing Rich Internet
Applications</i>. <span> </span>The design of the
program can be divided into two major components: (1) A user interface (ideally
suited for JavaFX design) and (2) the puzzle generator.<span> </span>For the context of this article, our primary
interest lies in the user interface.<span> </span>The
puzzle generator code was lifted from a sourceforge.net project and is written entirely
in Java.<span> </span>Regardless which version of the
UI we choose (JavaFX Script vs. JavaFX 2.0), no code changes were required for the puzzle generator code.</p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">The original user interface for the JavaFX Sudoku application
was written exclusively in JavaFX Script, and as such is a suitable candidate to
convert over to the new JavaFX 2.0 <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
model.<span> </span><span> </span>However, a few notable points are worth
mentioning about this program.<span> </span>First
off, it was written in the JavaFX 1.1 timeframe, where certain capabilities of
the JavaFX framework were as of yet unavailable.<span> </span>Citing two examples, this program creates
many of its own UI controls from scratch because the built-in controls were yet
to be introduced.<span> </span>In addition, layout of
graphical nodes is done in a very manual manner, again because much of the
automatic layout capabilities were in flux at the time.<span> </span>It is worth considering that this
program was written at a time when most of us were just coming up to speed on
this technology.<span> </span>One would think that
having the opportunity to recreate this application anew, it would look a lot
different from the current version.</p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Comparing the Size of
the Source Code</b></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">An attempt was made to convert each of the original UI JavaFX
Script source files (suffixed with .fx) over to a Java counterpart.<span> </span>Due to language feature differences, there
are a small number of source files which only exist in one version or the
other. <span> </span>The table below summarizes the
size of each of the source files. </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">A few notes about this table are in order:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></span>The number of lines in each file was determined
by running the Unix ‘wc –l’ command over each file.<span></span></li> 
    <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></span>The number of characters in each file was
determined by running the Unix ‘ls –l’ command over each file.</li> 
    <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></span>The examination of the code could certainly be
much more rigorous. No standard formatting was performed on these files.&nbsp; All comments however were deleted.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">There was a certain expectation that the new Java version
would require more lines of code than the original JavaFX script version.<span> </span>As evidenced by a count of the total number
of lines, the Java version has about 22% more lines than its FX Script
counterpart.<span></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span><span> </span>Furthermore, there was an additional expectation
that the Java version would be more verbose in terms of the total number of
characters.&nbsp; In fact the preceding data shows that on average the Java source files contain fewer characters per line than the FX files.&nbsp; But that's not the whole story.&nbsp; Upon further examination, the FX Script source files had a disproportionate number of blank characters.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because of the nature of how one develops JavaFX Script code.&nbsp; The object literal dominates FX Script code.&nbsp; Its not uncommon to see object literals indented halfway across the page, consuming lots of meaningless space characters.</p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RAM consumption</b></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">Not the most scientific analysis, memory usage for
the application was examined on a Windows Vista system by running the Windows
Task Manager and viewing how much memory was being consumed by the Sudoku
version in question.<span> </span>Roughly speaking, the
FX script version, after startup, had a RAM footprint of about 90MB and remained
pretty much the same size.<span> </span>The Java
version started out at about 55MB and maintained that size throughout its execution.</p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>What About Binding?</b></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">Arguably, the most striking observation about the conversion
from JavaFX Script to JavaFX 2.0 concerned the need for data synchronization, or lack thereof.<span> </span>In JavaFX Script, the primary means to synchronize
data is via the bind expression (using the “bind” keyword), and perhaps to a
lesser extent it’s “on replace” cousin.<span> </span>The bind keyword does not exist in Java, so for JavaFX 2.0 a Data Binding API has been introduced as a replacement.</p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">To give a feel for the difference between the two versions
of the Sudoku program, the table that follows indicates how many binds were
required for each source file.<span> </span>For
JavaFX Script files, this was ascertained by simply counting the number of
occurrences of the <i>bind</i> keyword.<span> </span>As can be seen, binding had been used
frequently in the JavaFX Script version (and does not take into consideration
an additional half dozen or so “<i>on
replace”</i> triggers). The JavaFX 2.0 program achieves the same functionality as the original JavaFX Script version,
yet the equivalent of binding was only needed twice throughout the Java version of the source code. <span></span></p>

<p>I am not sure that the JavaFX 2.0 version of Sudoku program does require very fewer bindings than 1.1<br/>
What makes that possible?</p>

<p>As per a previous blog entitled, Why I like the New JavaFX, here's some more rationale:</p>


<p>The new JavaFX results in, for lack of a better term, more predictability. One of the primary JavaFX Script mechanisms used to define and place graphical assets (Nodes) into the scenegraph is the object literal notation. Being static in nature, the notion of a sequential flow of events inside an object literal may not make much sense. To compensate, JavaFX Script introduces the powerful concept of binding. Without question, binding is very elegant, but it comes with a price. It is not uncommon to see liberal and arguably unnecessary use of binding throughout JavaFX script code.</p>


<p>One can argue that bringing JavaFX to Java should lessen, but certainly not eliminate, the need for binding. Rather than defining objects inside a static initializer, JavaFX API objects are created and defined sequentially by constructor and method calls respectively. By defining objects in an order that makes sense, there is potential to eliminate a certain class of dependencies that were previously resolved with binding. </p>

<p>Hi Jim,<br/>
Thanks for the lovely post. However, is there any way we could get hold of the converted code (in Java)? I'm migrating a big application from 1.3 to 2.0 and looking at your converted code would be a big help. <br/>
Thanks. </p>

<p>Here's the current situation:  Even though JavaFX 2.0 is in public Beta, the API is still in flux, so much so that every time I pull down a newer internal build, something breaks.  The code used for this test is hopelessly obsolete with regards to the latest API.  The good news (I think) is that we are hopefully coming to and end to all these changes, where we'll draw a line in the sand and say the API is frozen.  But that hasn't happened yet.  Once it does, then, given some time, I'll migrate over to the latest stable API and post.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately not.  It's really old and pretty crappy too.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely this old dog (who can learn new tricks, but at a snail's pace) came to the realization that although still quite relevant, a whole generation of people prefer not to read lengthy writings, but would rather digest information in small pieces using new media formats.&nbsp; Thus the rationale for the following blog...</p> 
  <p>Certainly no thespian when it comes to public speaking, I will say this:&nbsp; based upon my experience demonstrating Java SE on embedded devices, people have definitely expressed genuine interest.&nbsp; Maybe it was the cool device (i.e. Plug Computer) which was used, or maybe this combination of hardware and software inspired the audience to think of the possibilities presented by this new platform.&nbsp; Either way, I thought it might make sense to capture a shortened presentation/demonstration session.&nbsp; Following is a 30 minute session broken down into two 15 minute videos (because YouTube only allows videos of 15 minutes or less for mere mortals). They aim to demonstrate how 
developers already familiar with the Java SE development paradigm can 
leverage that knowledge to seamlessly develop on very capable embedded 
processors.&nbsp; Happy viewing!</p>

<p>This HOL far exceeded my expectations. It all worked well, with a decent footprint and performance, and real debuggers! On a $99 PlugComputer module. When I can start actually using this? So I have been puzzled by the lack of followup by the team. Is JSE Embedded real? Where can we download what we need to try using it in a new product? And dare we do so if that product has to ship for, say, 5-10 years (which is actually on the low end of many embedded system life cycles)? What support is there if we are not a billion dollar customer and are &quot;only&quot; planning to ship perhaps 500-5000 systems per year, to start? Is embedded Java a viable option for us? Inquiring minds want to know...</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>


<p>It&rsquo;s possible write a stand-alone java se embedded to work with bluetooth ?<br/>
Running in a small device, such as an beagleboard ARM?</p>


<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Him Michela,</p>


<p>The answer to your question is, it depends.  I have demonstrated Bluetooth/Java functionality on the Plug Computer with BlueCove, an implementation of JSR 82, the Bluetooth Java specification.  However, the specification only supports a handful of the 25 or so Bluetooth profiles.  In addition to the lack of an API for these higher end profiles, linux kernel and user software modules are also required which typically are not included (yet) in the standard embedded linux distributions.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Is it possible to run Xlet and Lwuit based java application on it?</p>


<p>Not sure about Xlets, but check out the LWUIMB project at <a href="http://lwuimb.thenesis.org/" rel="nofollow">http://lwuimb.thenesis.org/</a> for a description of a port of LWUIT that can run on top of Java SE.</p>


<p>&gt;&gt;Can anyone provide the link to download the Java SE Embedded executable for Linux x86 based system?</p>


<p>Go to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html</a> and look for the &quot;x86 Linux Small Footprint - Headless&quot; link.  There is no executable to install, rather the software is gzip'ed.  Just extract to install.</p>

<p>Today marks an important milestone for JavaFX 2.0.&nbsp; Prior to this date, only a select few partners had early access privilege to the technology, and for good reason.&nbsp; During that early access period, the API was in a very fluid state, and from personal experience I can tell you that changes to the JavaFX 2.0 API were done almost on a build-by-build basis.&nbsp; The announcement of a public beta not only makes the software available worldwide, but also signals that the JavaFX 2.0 API is on much more solid footing.</p> 
  <p>So check out the <a href="http://javafx.com">javafx.com</a> website for the latest JavaFX 2.0 information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three software downloads are now available:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li><b>JavaFX 2.0 Beta SDK</b> - the JavaFX functionality needed to develop directly via the command line or with other tools</li> 
    <li><b>JavaFX 2.0 Beta Runtime</b> - the runtime environment required for running JavaFX 2.0 applications&nbsp;</li> 
    <li><b>JavaFX 2.0 Beta Plugin for NetBeans IDE 7.0</b> -&nbsp; for building, previewing, and debugging JavaFX applications in NetBeans 7.<br /></li>

At the current time, yes.  As you may know, Oracle does not like to make forward looking statements.  That being said we hope to make JavaFX 2.0 available for MacOS sometime in the future.  Ironically, a large number of our developers use Macs as their development platform, so there certainly is motivation here.  As far as other platforms (e.g. Linux) go, Oracle is taking a wait and see approach.

<p>
Developing applications for embedded platforms gets simpler all the time, thanks in part to the tremendous advances in microprocessor design and software tools.&nbsp; And in particular, with the availability of Java SE compatible Virtual Machines for the popular embedded platforms, development has never been more straightforward.<br /></p> 
  <p>The real beauty behind Java SE Embedded development lies in the fact that you can use your favorite IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, JDeveloper ...) to create, test and debug code in the <b><i>identical</i></b> fashion in which you'd develop a standard desktop or server application.&nbsp; When the time comes to try it out on a Java SE Embedded capable device, it's just a matter of shipping the bytecodes over to the device and letting it run.&nbsp; There is no need for complicated emulators, toolchains and cross-compilers.&nbsp; The exact same bytecodes that ran on your PC, run <i><b>unmodified</b></i> on the embedded device.</p> 
  <p>In fact, because all versions of Java SE (embedded or not) share a considerable amount of common code, we have plenty of anecdotal evidence which supports the notion that behavior -- correct or incorrect -- manifests itself identically across platforms.&nbsp; We refer specifically here to bugs.&nbsp; Now no one wants bugs, but believe it or not, our customers like the fact that behavior is consistent across platforms whether it's right or not. &quot;Bug for bug compatibility&quot; has actually become a strong selling point!</p> 
  <p>Having espoused the virtues of transparently developing off device, many still wish to test and debug on-device regularly as part of their development cycle.&nbsp; If you're the touchy/feely type, there are ample examples of affordable and supported off-the-shelf devices that could fit the bill for an <i>Unofficial Java SE Embedded SDK</i>.&nbsp; One such platform is the <a href="http://plugcomputer.org/">Plug Computer</a>.</p> 
  <p><img src="/jtc/resource/java_se-e/plug.jpg" /><img src="/jtc/resource/java_se-e/plug2.jpg" /> The reference platform for the Plug Computer is supplied by <a href="http://www.marvell.com/platforms/plug_computer/">Marvell Technology Group</a>. Manufacturers then license the technology from Marvell to create their own specific implementations.&nbsp; Two such vendors are <a href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/">GlobalScale</a> and <a href="http://www.ionicsplug.com/products.html">Ionics</a>.&nbsp; These are incredibly capable devices that include Arm processors in the 1.2GHz to 2.0GHz range, and sport 512MB of RAM and flash.&nbsp; There are a host of external port and interface options including USB, µUSB, SATA, GBE, SD, WiFi, ZigBee, Z-Wave and soon HDMI.&nbsp; Additionally, several Linux distros are available for these systems too.&nbsp; The typical cost for a base model is $99, and perhaps the most disruptive aspect of these systems,<i> they consume on average about 5 watts of power</i>.</p> 
  <p>Alongside developing in the traditional manner, the ability to step through and examine state on these devices via remote debugging comes as a standard feature with the Java SE-E VM.&nbsp; Furthermore, you can use the JConsole application from your desktop to remotely monitor performance and resource consumption on the device.<br /></p> 
  <p>So what would a bill of materials look like for <i>The Unofficial Java SE Embedded SDK</i>?&nbsp; Pretty simple actually:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">Latest NetBeans Java SE IDE</a> (or any other of your favorite Java IDEs)&nbsp;</li> 
    <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/embedded-jsp-135769.html">Java SE Embedded ARMv5 Linux - Headless</a></li> 
    <li> <a href="http://www.ionicsplug.com/nimbus100.html">Ionics Nimbus 100</a> or <a href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/p-22-sheevaplug-dev-kit-us.aspx">GlobalScale SheevaPlug Dev Kit</a></li> 
  </ul>That's about it.&nbsp; Of course, for higher level functionality, you can add additional packages.&nbsp; For example, <a href="www.apache.org">Apache</a> runs beautifully here.&nbsp; Could anyone imagine a large number of these devices acting as a parallel web server?<br /> <br />

BODY: 
<p>As embedded processor designs continue their inexorable drive towards ever increasing capability, the natural desire to utilize more robust software platforms, previously reserved for powerful desktop computers and servers, follows suit.&nbsp; Recognizing this trend, a version of the Java Standard Edition platform, called <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/overview/index.html">Java SE Embedded</a>, has been developed to address this growing market.&nbsp; In addition to bringing all of the benefits of the ubiquitous Java Standard Edition to the most popular embedded processors, static footprint and memory optimizations have been realized.&nbsp; To get a feel for some of the space savings, check out this <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/reduced-footprint-java-se-brin">article</a>.</p> 
  <p>Partly due to the turmoil surrounding the Oracle acquisition of Sun, a refresh of the Java SE Embedded binaries took longer than anticipated.&nbsp; The new versions are now available for <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/index.html">download</a> with these <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/overview/sys-reqs-embedded-159989.html">supported configurations</a>.&nbsp; During that time frame, Java SE-E engineers were able take care of some internal housekeeping which should help for better synchronization of future releases of Java SE with Java SE-E.&nbsp; In the past, Java SE-E engineers would take a snapshot of the Java Standard Edition code and incorporate their modifications to create a new release, forking from the standard edition source,.&nbsp; Now, the Java SE-E code is part of the overall Java SE project, such that future Java SE enhancements and bug fixes should now be automatically incorporated into the Java SE-E code base.</p> 
  <p>The refreshed Java SE-E binaries are based on the Java SE 6 Update 21, and represent substantial security, performance and quality enhancements.&nbsp; Benchmark tests show that, for example, simply replacing the previous versions of the Java SE-E virtual machines with the latest binaries produces on average about 20% performance gain for the same hardware/OS combination.&nbsp; Having recently introduced a Just-In-Time (or JIT) compiler to the Android Dalvik Virtual Machine, we thought it would be an interesting exercise to compare performance of Java SE-E to Android on identical hardware.&nbsp; For a full explanation of the results and methodology, check out <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/javaseembedded/2010/11/how_does_android_22s_performance_stack_up_against_java_se_embedded.html">Bob Vandette's blog</a> on this topic.&nbsp; To cut to the chase, for the selected benchmarks, Java SE-E outperforms Android by a factor of two.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>Improving virtual machine performance is a tedious process that takes time.&nbsp; The bottom line is this:&nbsp; Java SE Virtual Machine engineers have been at this for a very long time, and have had the benefit of fifteen years of scrutiny from the computer science community.&nbsp; It will take considerable time and effort for Android to come close to this capability.&nbsp; In the interim, the Java Virtual Machine performance and quality improvement marches on.<br /></p> 
  <p><img src="/jtc/resource/java_se-e/plug.jpg" /><img src="/jtc/resource/java_se-e/plug2.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp; Next up: Take a look at these pictures.&nbsp; Based upon Marvell's Plug Computer design, these amazing devices pack a 1+GHz Arm processor with 512MB RAM and consume a minuscule 5 watts of power. They run Java SE-E beautifully.&nbsp; Combined with an IDE like <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>, this makes for an ideal, although unofficial, Java SE Embedded Development Kit.<br /></p>

<p>While the performance difference it interesting it does not give a good comparison for real life usage where many applications run at the same time concurrently and do all sorts of tasks. Show me a JavaSE powered phone with a lot of apps and a decent user interface, developer community and lots of different modern devices you can actually get your hands on and I will take a look. Until then I choose Android.</p>

<p>This version of JavaSE is not intended for phones.  In fact, many of the Java SE Embedded binaries are for headless devices.  We compare against Android because they have their sight set on this market.</p>


<p>As far as phones go, all the attention these days surrounds smart phone platforms like the ones from Apple, RIM, Android and Nokia.  That's fine, but realize that smart phone still makes up a very small percentage of the phones sold worldwide. This is where JavaME (not SE) comes into play.  In fact over 3 billion phones have shipped with JavaME to date.</p>

<p>Even for embedded, headless devices raw performance of one app is not necessarily showing the real performance of an actual device.</p>


<p>And in terms of smartphones I am aware of the huge number of phones that shipped with JavaME. However at this stage it looks very much like JavaME powered phones are on the decline and Android and other smartphone are on the rise. The market is shifting a lot and at this stage it looks like JavaME is missing the train.  </p>


<p>Also the developer experience for JavaME is a lot worse than it is for Android. </p>

<p>We'll I think we've seen this sort of paralysis many a time, too afraid to change for loss of revenue, reminds me of the Unix Workstation.  Java phone dev's want Java 5 language features, Google gives it to them, it's not as good as the real thing, but it'll do.  Now it has market share and developer mindshare.</p>


<p>Stop stuffing around and release Java SE Embedded with LWUIT, on top of the Linux (or Solaris) kernel.  SavaJE ring a bell?</p>


<p>Or don't change and let the robot's invade the java embedded market too.  What next Google TV?  Can poor old CDC compete?</p>

            <p class="MsoNormal">I have a vested interest in seeing the original JavaFX
Script based platform prosper. <span> </span>As an early
adopter of this technology, a good portion of my life these past few years has
been spent developing, blogging and even co-authoring a book on the
subject.<span> </span>So when the inevitable demise
of JavaFX Script was formally announced, those of us intimately involved did
not take it lightly.</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span></span>Perhaps not unlike yourselves, I’ve viewed the plans to morph JavaFX into a Java API with a bit of
skepticism. <span> </span>The new resulting coding paradigm
is unquestionably less stylish than its predecessor and can be downright
verbose. <span> </span>But the new way grows on you. <span> </span>Having the privilege to experiment with early
versions, I’ve come to like the new platform.<span> </span>In fact I like it a lot.<span> </span>Here’s
why I think the new JavaFX platform is more attractive:</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The community has
spoken and it doesn’t feel the need for yet another scripting language.</b><span> </span>The attempt to lure graphics designers into
the Java camp by offering a simplified Rich Internet Application environment never
really panned out.<span> </span>Why? <span> </span>First, there already exists a wealth of mature,
established RIA scripting alternatives.<span> </span>These address much of what designers need and JavaFX Script is not sufficiently
different enough.<span> </span>Second, the clamor to
provide RIA capabilities in Java comes from the Java community proper, not the
graphics artists. <span> </span><span> </span>These developers have a lot invested in Java
and are not interested in learning a new language.<span> </span>What they want is a Java API with RIA capabilities.<span> </span>By making JavaFX a first class citizen of the
Java platform, it goes a long way towards meeting these desires.</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The JavaFX API is a
more universal solution.</b><span> </span>By building
an API in Java, the opportunity for developers of other dynamic languages (like
JRuby and JavaScript) to access JavaFX has been made much easier.<span> </span>Moreover, as the trend to host other
languages atop the Java Virtual Machine accelerates, these too will profit from
this move.</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>No more mapping between
JavaFX Script and Java</b>.<span> </span>A derivative
of Java, one of the touted advantages of JavaFX Script is its ability to
seamlessly integrate and leverage the wealth of Java code written already.<span> </span>Indeed a very important benefit, Java/JavaFX
Script integration is mostly straightforward; however there are subtle
differences between both languages that the developer must take into
consideration.<span> </span>Mapping primitive Java
data types to JavaFX basic types can be an issue.<span> </span>The original JavaFX classes can only extend
Java classes that contain a default (no arguments) constructor.<span> </span>Features familiar to Java programmers, like
multidimensional arrays, generics, annotations, and multi-threading have no
real equivalent in JavaFX Script.<span> </span>Bringing the JavaFX class libraries directly onto the Java platform
eliminates all of these concerns. <span> </span>If you
want to use some external Java code, just use it.</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Superior Development
Environment</b>.<span> </span>Attempting to debug JavaFX
Script within an Integrated Development Environment is at best a tricky
endeavor and at worst a waste of time. <span> </span>Additionally
only NetBeans, and to a lesser extent Eclipse, are the only viable JavaFX
Script capable IDEs.<span> </span>As the new JavaFX platform
is entirely based on Java, not only is debugging support first rate, the option
of choosing other Java IDEs opens up considerably.</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The new JavaFX results in, for lack of a better term, more
predictability</b>. <span> </span>One of the primary JavaFX
Script mechanisms used to define and place graphical assets (Nodes) into the
scenegraph is the object literal notation.<span> </span>Being static in nature, the notion of a sequential flow of events inside
an object literal may not make much sense.<span> </span>To compensate, JavaFX Script introduces the powerful concept of binding.<span> </span>Without question, binding is very elegant, but
it comes with a price.<span> </span>It is not
uncommon to see liberal and arguably unnecessary use of binding throughout JavaFX
script code.<span> </span></p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">One can argue that bringing JavaFX to Java should lessen,
but certainly not eliminate, the need for binding.<span> </span>Rather than defining objects inside a static initializer,
JavaFX API objects are created and defined sequentially by constructor and method
calls respectively.<span> </span>By defining objects
in an order that makes sense, there is potential to eliminate a certain class
of dependencies that were previously resolved with binding. </p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Improved performance.</b><span> </span>Although by default the JavaFX compiler generates
Java bytes codes from JavaFX Script source, there is a command-line option
which can be invoked to save the intermediate Java code that is produced as
part of the process.<span> </span>A brief perusal of
this source shows that even the most humble of JavaFX Script constructs churns
out a lot of complicated Java code.<span> </span>Eliminating
this overhead is bound to improve performance in many instances.<span> </span>Furthermore, significant optimizations to
memory and static footprint as well as startup time are underway.<span> </span>Finally a new lightweight, fast graphics
subsystem, dubbed project prism, will obviate the need to utilize older Java
graphics windowing systems. </p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>It’s not how you
feel, it’s how you look. </b><span> </span>A
superficial difference, but nonetheless one that should not be underestimated, lies
in what your code looks like.<span> </span>In JavaFX
Script, graphical Nodes are typically placed in the scenegraph via the
definition of object literals.<span> </span><span> </span>Even the least sophisticated of object literal
scenegraphs can be grouped and nested several levels deep, each nesting moving
the source code further to the right.<span> </span>Some JavaFX Script code is so indented it leaves little room to write
anything of consequence without having to split a line of code into two or more
lines.</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">It didn’t take very long to come up with these talking
points.<span> </span>No doubt, as development progresses
and more folks jump on board, additional benefits will become apparent. </p></m:defjc></m:rmargin></m:lmargin></m:dispdef></m:smallfrac>

<p>Will there be a migration tool from JavaFX script to JavaFX with Java?  The situation right now is that no one wants to write JavaFX script any more since Oracle announced to kill it, yet the new version can not be used yet, even as a beta.</p>

<p>I know of no migration tool in the works.  In case you were unaware, ongoing development of JavaFX Script has been taken up with the open source project called Visage.  Plans call for the project to address some of the shortcomings mentioned above.

<p>As a Swing programmer, I wasn't really tempted to learn JavaFX, and found it less and less appealing once I discovered programs weren't even compatible from a version to the next. I'm more  interested by learning a new Java API but I have to learn everything about JavaFX. Please give us more links.<br/>
When will it be available? <br/>
Is there some kind of demo that shows how code will look like? <br/>
Will it be available in Java SE?<br/>
Any other links that you feel relevant?</p>

<p>One big difference between philosophies at Sun and Oracle is that Oracle is very concerned about how any future product announcement might adversely affect current opportunities.  As such, Oracle is much more guarded about futures.  Your best bet is to look at the published roadmap information supplied on the javafx website at <a href="http://javafx.com/roadmap/" rel="nofollow">http://javafx.com/roadmap/</a></p>

<p>Thank you for your no answer (no offense, I understand that you can't tell more that you're allowed to ;-).<br/>
My bet is that I'll wait for something more substantial than a roadmap.</p>

<p>Hi,<br/>
Thanks for the article. I use Swing for Rolling Thunder and use the defualt Nimbus and offer additional skins (Substance). I like the look and feel of JavaFX and would like to see it adopted by swing. I am not sure if Oracle is headed in that direction. Any thoughts on that?<br/>
I would like the ability to use the caption area for buttons for example. Basically have a more area efficient UI.</p>

TITLE: NetBeans with Subversion, SSH and Windows
DATE: 02/19/2010 19:59:31
PRIMARY CATEGORY: Sun
STATUS: publish
ALLOW COMMENTS: 1
-----
BODY: 
<p>Having spent too much time wrestling with the various components required to get NetBeans to access a subversion repository via ssh, I thought it might make sense to jot down a few notes in an effort to save others from such hardships.<br /></p> 
  <p>NetBeans does have built-in support for CVS, Mercurial and Subversion, but that doesn't mean that these source code revision systems work in a turnkey fashion.&nbsp; In particular, subversion, especially with Windows, does require some work.</p> 
  <p> 
  1. To start:<br />Get the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">latest JDK</a>.&nbsp; At the time of this writing it was JDK 6 update 18<br />Get the <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">latest version of NetBeans</a>,&nbsp; in this case, NetBeans 6.8.&nbsp; Install it referencing the latest JDK and furthermore, once inside NetBeans, utilize the update manager to make sure all of your modules are the latest and greatest.<br /></p> 
  <p>2. Upon starting NetBeans, the menu running along the top of the window has a &quot;Team&quot; entry.&nbsp; Click on Team and follow Subversion-&gt;Checkout (No, you won't be able to check anything out yet). This will bring up an error window which requires you to install a subversion client.<br /></p> 
  <p>Selecting the default action, which installs a subversion plugin for NetBeans, didn't result in much success. Instead choose the second option: &quot;Install Subversion Commandline Client&quot;. &nbsp;The recommended download for the client points to CollabNet, which is an excellent choice.&nbsp; Unfortunately the version referred to (v 1.5.5 for Windows) may ultimately prove problematic if you're communicating with a subversion repository that's based on a later version. For this exercise,  <a href="http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/subversion/">CollabNet Subversion Command-Line Client v1.6.9 (for Windows)</a> was downloaded and installed.<br /></p> 
  <p>3. Once Subversion is installed, clicking on Team-&gt;Subversion-&gt;Checkout again will hopefully bring up a second window which requires you fill in two textfields: (1) A repository URL and (2) a tunnel command.&nbsp; Let's focus on the tunnel command first.&nbsp; For windows this requires the equivalent of the Unix/Linux ssh command.&nbsp; To get this functionality <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/download.html">download and install a version of the PuTTY software package</a>.</p> 
  <p>4. Unlike the Collabnet Subversion Client, PuTTY installation does not put the executables of this package into your PATH.&nbsp; Make sure to add the PuTTY path (typically C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY) to your PATH.</p> 
  <p>5. You'll need to edit a subversion configuration file to specify the tunnel command as follows:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>C:\\&gt;cd %APPDATA%\\Subversion
C:\\&gt;edit config 
</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Look for the comment that starts like this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>#ssh = $SVN_SSH ssh</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Uncomment it and make it look like the statement below.&nbsp; The <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">plink.exe</font> executable is part of the PuTTY software bundle:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>ssh = $SVN_SSH plink.exe -l <b><i>user</i></b> -pw <b><i>password</i></b> 
</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Where <i>user</i> is your remote user name and <i>password</i> is your user's password. You can also use private key authentication if you're uncomfortable with putting your password in the clear, which might look something like:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>ssh = $SVN_SSH plink.exe -l <i>user</i> -i C:\\my_private_key.ppk</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>6. Prior to trying out Netbeans, first connect to your subversion repository via ssh as follows:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>C:\\&gt; plink.exe <b><i>user</i></b>@<b><i>host</i></b></pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Prior to running this command, the NetBeans attempt to access the subversion repository hangs, apparently looking for a host fingerprint cache entry.&nbsp; The <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">plink.exe</font> command above accomplishes its creation, once the correct password is entered.&nbsp; In addition, it assures that SSH is correctly set up on your Subversion repository server.<br /></p> 
  <p>7. Returning to the Team-&gt;Subversion-&gt;Checkout selection from the main NetBeans window, now it's time to fill in the two textfields.&nbsp; The first entry should look something like this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>svn+ssh://<i><b>host</b></i>/<b><i>subversion_repository_path</i></b></pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>for example:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>svn+ssh://127.0.0.1/home/svn/myProject</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Next should come the tunnel command which should be similar to the entry placed in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">%APPDATA%\\Subversion\\config</font> file, namely</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>plink -l <i><b>user</b></i> -pw <i><b>password</b></i></pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Where, again, <i>user i</i>s your remote user name and <i>password</i> is this user's password.</p> 
  <p>8. With information correctly filled in, and assuming your subversion server is correctly configured, you should be able to begin utilizing subversion through ssh with NetBeans.&nbsp; For further information, check out:</p>

  </ul> 
  <p>Good Luck!<br /></p>

<p>Thanks for your post! I never would have figured out step 6. I can't imagine that was an intentional &quot;required&quot; step. Maybe Netbeans can fix this...or at least document it!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<p>
When contemplating how machine-dependent applications might communicate with Java/JavaFX, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface">JNI or the Java Native Interface</a>, having been created for just such a task, would likely be the first mechanism that comes to mind.&nbsp; Although JNI works just fine thank you, a group of us ultimately decided against using it for a small project because, among others:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Errors in your JNI implementation can corrupt the Java Virtual Machine in very strange ways, leading to difficult diagnosis.<br /></li> 
    <li>JNI can be time consuming and tedious, especially if there's a varied amount of interchange between the Native and Java platforms.</li> 
    <li>For each OS/Platform supported, a separate JNI implementation would need to be created and maintained.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Instead we opted for something a bit more mundane, namely sockets.&nbsp; The socket programming paradigm has been around a long time, is well understood and spans a multitude of hardware/software platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than spending time defining JNI interfaces, just open up a socket between applications and send messages back and forth, defining your own message protocol.&nbsp; Following are some reflections on using sockets with JavaFX and Java.&nbsp; For the sake of simplicity, we'll skip the native stuff and focus on how sockets can be incorporated into a JavaFX application in a thread safe manner.<br /></p> 
  <h4>Sockets and Threading<br /></h4> 
  <p>Socket programming, especially in Java, lends itself to utilizing threads.&nbsp; Because a socket <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">read()</font> will block waiting for input, a common practice is to place the read loop in a background thread enabling you to continue processing while waiting for input at the same time.&nbsp; And if you're doing this work entirely in Java, you'll find that both ends of the socket connection -- the &quot;server&quot; side and the &quot;client&quot; side -- share a great deal of common code.&nbsp; Recognizing this, an abstract class called <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/GenericSocket.java">GenericSocket.java</a> was created which is responsible for housing the common functionality shared by &quot;server&quot; and &quot;client&quot; sockets including the setup of a reader thread to handle socket reads asynchronously.</p> 
  <p>For this simple example, two implementations of the abstract <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">GenericSocket</font> class, one called <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketServer.java">SocketServer.java</a>, the other called <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketClient.java">SocketClient.java</a> have been supplied.&nbsp; The primary difference between these two classes lies in the type of socket they use.&nbsp; SocketServer.java uses <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">java.net.ServerSocket</font><a href="http://java.net.ServerSocket">,</a>&nbsp; while SocketClient.java uses <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">java.net.Socket<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></font>.&nbsp; The respective implementations contain the details required to set up and tear down these slightly different socket types.</p> 
  <h4>Dissecting the Java Socket Framework<br /></h4> 
  <p>If you want to utilize the provided Java socket framework with JavaFX, you need to understand this very important fact:&nbsp; <b><i>JavaFX is not thread safe and all JavaFX manipulation should be run on the JavaFX processing thread</i></b>.<sup>1</sup> If you allow a JavaFX application to interact with a thread other than
the main processing thread, unpredictable errors will
occur.&nbsp; Recall that the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">GenericSocket</font> class created a reader thread to handle socket reads.&nbsp; In order to avoid non-main-thread-processing and its pitfalls with our socket classes, a few modifications must take place.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="1">[1] Stolen from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaFX-Developing-Rich-Internet-Applications/dp/013701287X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264908598&amp;sr=8-2">JavaFX: Developing Rich Internet Applications</a> - Thanks <a href="/clarkeman">Jim Clarke</a></font></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <h5>Step 1: Identify Resources Off the Main Thread<br /></h5> 
  <blockquote> </blockquote> 
  <p>The first step to operating in a thread safe manner is to identify those resources in your Java code, residing off the main thread, that might need to be accessed by JavaFX.&nbsp; For our example, we define two abstract methods, the first, <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onMessage()</font>, is called whenever a line of text is read from the socket.&nbsp; The <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/GenericSocket.java">GenericSocket.java</a> code will make a call to this method upon encountering socket input. Let's take a look at the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketReaderThread</font> code inside <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">GenericSocket</font>, to get a feel for what's going on.</p> 
  <pre>    class SocketReaderThread extends Thread {

        @Override
        public void run() {
            String line;
            waitForReady();
            /\*
             \* Read from from input stream one line at a time
             \*/
            try {
                if (input != null) {
                    while ((line = input.readLine()) != null) {
                        if (debugFlagIsSet(DEBUG_IO)) {
                            System.out.println("recv&gt; " + line);
                        }
                        /\*
                         \* The onMessage() method has to be implemented by
                         \* a sublclass.  If used in conjunction with JavaFX,
                         \* use Entry.deferAction() to force this method to run
                         \* on the main thread.
                         \*/
                        <b>onMessage(line);</b>
                    }
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                if (debugFlagIsSet(DEBUG_EXCEPTIONS)) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            } finally {
                notifyTerminate();
            }
        }
</pre> 
  <p> Because <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onMessage()</font> is called off the main thread and inside <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketReaderThread</font>, the comment states that some additional work, which we'll explain soon, must take place to assure main thread processing.<br /></p> 
  <p>Our second method, <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onClosedStatus()</font>, is called whenever the status of the socket changes (either opened or closed for whatever reason).&nbsp; This abstract routine is called in different places within <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/GenericSocket.java">GenericSocket.java</a> -- sometimes on the main thread, sometimes not.&nbsp; To assure thread safety, we'll employ the same technique as with <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onMessage()</font>.</p> 
  <h5>Step 2: Create a Java Interface with your Identified Methods<br /></h5> 
  <p> Once identified, these method signatures have to be declared inside a Java interface.&nbsp; For example, our socket framework includes a <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketListener.java">SocketListener.java</a> interface file which looks like this:</p> 
  <pre>   package genericsocket;

   public interface SocketListener {
       public void onMessage(String line);
       public void onClosedStatus(Boolean isClosed);
   }
</pre> 
  <h5>Step 3: Create Your Java Class, Implementing Your Defined Interface<br /></h5> 
  <p>With our <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketListener</font> interface defined, let's take a step-by-step look at how the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketServer</font> class is implemented inside <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketServer.java">SocketServer</a><a href="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketServer.java">.java</a>.&nbsp; One of the first requirements is to import a special Java class which will allow us to do main thread processing, achieved as follows:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  </p> 
  <pre>   import com.sun.javafx.runtime.Entry;
</pre> 
  <p>Next, comes the declaration of <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketServer</font>.&nbsp; Notice that in addition to extending the abstract <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">GenericSocket</font> class it also must implement our <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketListener</font> interface too:<br /></p> 
  <pre>   public class SocketServer extends GenericSocket implements SocketListener {
</pre> 
  <p>Inside the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketServer</font> definition, a variable called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">fxListener</font> of type <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketListener</font> is declared:</p> 
  <pre>       private SocketListener fxListener;
</pre> 
  <p>The constructor for <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketServer</font> must include a reference to <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">fxListener</font>.&nbsp; The other arguments are used to specify a port number and some debug flags.<br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <pre>       public SocketServer(SocketListener <b>fxListener</b>,
                int port, int debugFlags) {
            super(port, debugFlags);
            <b>this.fxListener = fxListener;</b>
       }
</pre> 
  <p>Next, let's examine the implementation of the two methods which are declared in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketListener</font> interface.&nbsp; The first, <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onMessage()</font>, looks like this:</p> 
  <pre>       /\*\*
        \* Called whenever a message is read from the socket.  In
        \* JavaFX, this method must be run on the main thread and
        \* is accomplished by the Entry.deferAction() call.  Failure to do so
        \* \*will\* result in strange errors and exceptions.
        \* @param line Line of text read from the socket.
        \*/
       @Override
       public void onMessage(<b>final</b> String line) {
           <b>Entry.deferAction</b>(new Runnable() {

               @Override
               public void run() {
                   fxListener.onMessage(line);
               }
           });
       }
</pre> 
  <p>As the comment points out, the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Entry.deferAction()</font> call enables <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">fxListener.onMessage()</font> to be executed on the main thread.&nbsp; It takes as an argument an instance of the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Runnable</font> class and, within its<font face="courier new,courier,monospace"> run()</font> method, makes a call to <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">fxListener.onMessage()</font>.&nbsp; Another important point to notice is that <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onMessage()</font>'s <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">String</font> argument&nbsp; must be declared as <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">final</font>.</p> 
  <p>Along the same line, the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onClosedStatus()</font> method is implemented as follows:</p> 
  <pre>       /\*\*
        \* Called whenever the open/closed status of the Socket
        \* changes.  In JavaFX, this method must be run on the main thread and
        \* is accomplished by the Entry.deferAction() call.  Failure to do so
        \* will\* result in strange errors and exceptions.
        \* @param isClosed true if the socket is closed
        \*/
       @Override
       public void onClosedStatus(<b>final</b> Boolean isClosed) {
           <b>Entry.deferAction</b>(new Runnable() {

               @Override
               public void run() {
                   fxListener.onClosedStatus(isClosed);
               }
           });
       }
</pre> 
  <p>Another <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Runnable</font> is scheduled via <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Entry.deferAction()</font> to run <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">fxlistener.onClosedStatus()</font> on the main thread. Again, <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onClosedStatus()</font>'s Boolean argument must also be defined as <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">final</font>.</p> 
  <h4>Accessing the Framework within JavaFX<br /></h4> 
  <p>With this work behind us, now we can integrate the framework into JavaFX.&nbsp; But before elaborating on the details, lets show screenshots of two simple JavaFX applications, <i>SocketServer</i> and <i>SocketClient</i> which, when run together, can send and receive text messages to one another over a socket.</p> 
  <p><a href="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketServer.jnlp"><img src="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketServer.jpg" style="width: 371px; height: 264px;" /></a> <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketClient.jnlp"><img src="/jtc/resource/socket/SocketClient.jpg" style="width: 371px; height: 265px;" /></a></p> 
  <p>These JavaFX programs were developed in NetBeans and utilize the recently announced <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/JavaFXComposer">NetBeans JavaFX Composer tool</a>.&nbsp; You can click on the images to execute these programs via Java WebStart.&nbsp; Note: depending upon your platform, your system may ask for permission prior to allowing these applications to network.&nbsp; Source for the JavaFX applications and the socket framework in the form of NetBeans projects can be downloaded <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/socketfx.zip">here</a>.</p> 
  <h5>Step 4: Integrating into JavaFX</h5> 
  <p>To access the socket framework within JavaFX, you must implement the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketListener</font> class that was created for this project.&nbsp; To give you a feel for how this is done with our JavaFX <i>SocketServer</i> application, here are some code excerpts from the project's Main.fx file, in particular the definition of our <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">ServerSocketListener</font> class:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>public class ServerSocketListener extends SocketListener {
    public override function onMessage(line: String) {
        insert line into recvListView.items;
    }
    public override function onClosedStatus(isClosed : java.lang.Boolean) {
        socketClosed = isClosed;
        tryingToConnect = false;
        if (autoConnectCheckbox.selected) {
            connectButtonAction();
        }
    }
}
</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sparing all of the gory details, the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onMessage()</font> method will place the line of text read from the socket in to a JavaFX <a href="http://java.sun.com/javafx/1.2/docs/api/javafx.scene.control/javafx.scene.control.ListView.html">ListView</a> control which is displayed in the program user interface.&nbsp; The <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">onClosedStatus()</font> method primarily updates the local <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">socketClosed</font> variable and attempts to reconnect the socket if the autoconnect option has been selected.</p> 
  <p>To demonstrate how the socket is created, we examine the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">connectButtonAction()</font> function:<br /></p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>var socketServer : SocketServer;

...

public function connectButtonAction (): Void {
     if (not tryingToConnect) {
            if (socketClosed) {
                <b>socketServer = new
                    SocketServer(ServerSocketListener{},
                    java.lang.Integer.parseInt(portTextbox.text),
                    javafx.util.Bits.bitOr(GenericSocket.DEBUG_STATUS,
                                           GenericSocket.DEBUG_IO));</b>
                tryingToConnect = true;
                <b>socketServer.connect();</b>
            }
        }
    }
</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre></pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <pre></pre> 
  <p>Whenever the user clicks on the &quot;Connect&quot; button, the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">connectButtonAction()</font> function will be called.&nbsp; On invocation, if the socket isn't already open, it will create a new <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketServer</font> instance.&nbsp; Recognize also that the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketServer</font> constructor includes an instance of the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">ServerSocketListener</font> class which was defined above.</p> 
  <p>To round this out, when the user clicks on the &quot;Disconnect&quot; button, the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">disconnectButtonAction()</font> function is called.&nbsp; When invoked, it tears down the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SocketServer</font> instance.<br /></p> 
  <pre>   function disconnectButtonAction (): Void {
        tryingToConnect = false;
        socketServer.shutdown();
   }</pre> 
  <h4>Conclusion</h4> 
  <p>Admittedly, there's a fair amount to digest here.&nbsp; Hopefully, by carefully reviewing the steps and looking at the <a href="/jtc/resource/socket/socketfx.zip">complete code listing</a>, this can serve as a template if you wish to accomplish something similar in JavaFX.<br /></p>

<p>So the JavaFX threading model sounds the same as the Swing threading model: all actions on one thread. So that seems to imply the need for JavaFXWorker akin to SwingWorker?</p>

<p>Hi, </p>


<p>I want only to do an observation about a problem that I've experienced using the code you provided.</p>


<p>I think that in the beginning of the  sendMessage function, you should have a waitForReady() call to avoid the case when the &quot;user&quot; tries to send a message before the SetupThread finishes.</p>


<p>Cheers,</p>


<p>Jo&atilde;o</p>

<p>Hi Jim Connor, this post is very interesting, in this momment javafx is in version 2, and use the JavaFx Scene Builder, the java fx 1.3 is deprecated, and i can't test your script. Maybe you are updated your project, if that is correct I I want to ask you upload the example code.</p>


<p>regards<br/>

BODY: 
<p>Until now, the idea of running something akin to a Java EE application server on a small handeld device would have been greeted with ridicule.&nbsp; Suddenly  that notion doesn't seem so ridiculous when considering the recent technology that's been made available. In particular, the following software advances make this pipe dream more of a reality:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/embedded/">Java Standard Edition for Embedded Devices</a>: A series of Java virtual machines are available from Sun for many of the popular embedded hardware/OS platforms. They are not only Java SE compatible, but have been space optimized from a static footprint and RAM perspective to perform in embedded environments.&nbsp; To give you an idea of some of those optimizations, read <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/reduced-footprint-java-se-brin">this</a>.<br /></li> 
    <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/JavaEE/JavaEE6Overview.html">Java Enterprise Edition 6 Platform Specification and the Web Profile</a>:&nbsp; The Java EE 6 specification allows for the creation of a subset of the component technologies, called &quot;profiles&quot;.&nbsp; The first of these has been dubbed the Web Profile and contains the common technologies required to create small to medium web applications.&nbsp; Rather than having to use a full blown Java EE application server in all its glory, you can take advantage of a significantly smaller, less complex framework.<br /></li> 
    <li><a href="https://embedded-glassfish.dev.java.net/">Embedded GlassFish</a>: This capability, which is now part of GlassFish v3, enables you to run GlassFish inside your Java application, as opposed to the other way around. Simply put, there is no need install GlassFish or create GlassFish domains in this scenario.&nbsp; Instead, you include an instance of glassfish-embedded-web.jar in your classpath, make a few GlassFish Embedded API calls from your standard Java application, and voila! you've got a web application up and running.<br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>The Hardware</h4> 
  <p>Rather than opting for one of the many embedded development platforms around (because I'm cheap), I instead decided to investigate what was available from a handheld perspective and see if that environment could be adapted to suit my needs.&nbsp; After some searching, it looked like the Nokia N810 just might fit the bill.&nbsp; Courtesy of my buddy Eric Bruno, here's a picture of the N810:<br /></p> 
  <p><img src="/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/N810.jpg" /> </p> 
  <p>To get a feel for this very capable device, check out <a href="http://www.ddj.com/java/208801979">Eric's Article</a>. What most interested me was that (1) it has 128MB RAM, (2)&nbsp; a 400MHz Arm v6 processor, (3) runs a common embedded version of Linux (<a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo</a>), (4) has a version of Java SE Embedded (from Sun) which runs fine on this platform and (5) can be had for a relatively affordable price on eBay.</p> 
  <h4>The Operating System</h4> 
  <p>The Nokia N810 is powered by the <a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo</a> distribution, an open source platform with a thriving community of developers.&nbsp; Knowing full well that any attempt to get a web application up and running on this device would stretch its resources to the limit, it was necessary to reclaim as much RAM as possible before starting out.&nbsp; Here's a description of some of the kludgery involved:<br /></p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>You'll need to download and install some additional applications which can be retrieved from the N810's Application Manager program.&nbsp; They include: <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">rootsh</font> to enable root access to the device and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">openssh-client</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">openssh-server</font> to remotely access the device.<br /></li> 
    <li>A quick and dirty way to reclaim RAM is to shut down the X-server and kill all of the windowing applications that run in parallel. There are certainly more elegant ways to do this, but in addition to being cheap, I'm lazy too.&nbsp; What you quickly find out is that any attempt to manually kill off some of these processes results in a reboot of the tablet.&nbsp; Why? Because by default, the N810 includes a watchdog process that monitors the state of the system.&nbsp; If it detects any irregularities, it forces a restart.</li> 
    <li>You can get around this problem by putting the device into what is called &quot;R&amp;D&quot; mode.&nbsp; This is achieved by downloading the &quot;flasher&quot; utility from maemo.org and establishing a USB connection between the N810 and your host computer.&nbsp; Directions for this process can be found <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Updating_the_tablet_firmware">here</a>.</li> 
    <li>Once established, you can invoke the following flasher command:&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">flasher3.5 --set-rd-flags=no-lifeguard-reset. </font>If this was done successfully, you'll notice that a wrench appears on the tablet screen when it is rebooted.<br /></li> 
    <li>Once in R&amp;D mode you'll have to remotely ssh into the device via the WiFi connection. The following script called <a href="/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/set-headless.sh"><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">set-headless.sh</font></a> has been provided to kill off the windowing system.&nbsp; After executing this script, the N810 in effect becomes a headless device.&nbsp; The only way to communicate with it is through the network.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>The Environment</h4> 
  <p>Here's what was required to get the web application up and running:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>Ssh into the device.<br /></li> 
    <li>Download an <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/embedded.jsp">evaluation copy of Java SE Embedded</a> (ARMv6 Linux - Headless).&nbsp; For this example the download file was gunzip'ed and untar'ed into the N810 device's /usr directory resulting in a new /usr/ejre1.6.0_10 directory.</li> 
    <li>Download a copy of <a href="http://download.java.net/maven/glassfish/org/glassfish/extras/glassfish-embedded-web/3.0/">glassfish-embedded-web-3.0.jar</a> and place this file in the /usr/ejre1.6.0_10/lib directory.</li> 
    <li>Modify your PATH variable to include /usr/ejre1.6.0_10/bin and set your JAVA_HOME variable to /usr/ejre1.6.0_10</li> 
    <li>Create a temporary directory, for this example we'll create a /root/tmp directory.</li> 
    <li>Compile the following Java source file, <a href="/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/Embedded.java">Embedded.java</a>,&nbsp; on a JDK equipped system, which is a slightly hacked version of the original provided by <a href="/alexismp">Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine</a>.</li> 
    <li>Create a glassfish directory under /root/tmp/ and place the compiled Embedded.class file there</li> 
    <li>Download the sample hello web application, <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/quickstart/hello.war">hello.war</a>, and place it in the /root/tmp directory.<a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/quickstart/hello.war"><br /></a></li> 
    <li>Reclaim as much RAM as possible by running the <a href="/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/set-headless.sh">set-headless.sh</a> script<br /></li> 
    <li>Run the web application from inside the /root/tmp directory via the the following command-line invocation: <br /></li> 
  </ol> 
  <pre>     # java -cp /usr/ejre1.6.0_10/lib/glassfish-embedded-web-3.0.jar:. glassfish/Embedded hello.war 600
</pre> 
  <p>As the N810 cannot match even the most modest of laptops in terms of performance, be prepared to wait around a little before the application is ready.&nbsp; Check this <a href="/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/log.txt">output</a> to see what is printed out to the console during invocation.</p> 
  <p>For this run the, N810 was assigned a WiFi IP address of 192.168.1.102, thus the browser is pointed to that address with port 8888.&nbsp; Here's what comes up:</p> 
  <p><img src="/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/N810hello1.jpg" /> </p> 
  <p>And Interacting with the web app produces this:</p> 
  <p> <img src="/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/N810hello2.jpg" /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>So this is obviously not ready for prime time, but it does open up a whole lot more possibilities in the near future.</p> 
  <p>Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p>

If you're reading this article, the chances are real good that your home is full of electronic gadgets.&nbsp; Moreover many are permanently plugged into wall sockets. &nbsp; Having recently purchased a <a href="http://www.p3international.com/products/p4460.html">P3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ</a> power meter, I've been running around getting a feel for how much energy some of these common components use. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><img src="/jtc/resource/consumer_electronics/p4460.jpg" /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>For this first table, I wanted to see how much energy was being consumed by audio/visual components that were <i>plugged into the wall, but not powered on.</i>&nbsp; Indeed some of these numbers are eye-opening:</p> 
  <p> </p>

  <p>The granularity of the P4460 is hundredths of kilowatt-hours, which means that in order to get a decent reading on a low-power device, you've got to leave it attached for a while.&nbsp; No doubt some of these measurements could be more accurate, but I think you get the point.&nbsp; Of note:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>The 4 components that comprise the audio system consume over 22 watts all day, every day 24x7.</li> 
    <li>As set top boxes gain more functionality (e.g. DVR), they suck up even more power.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this rate, you'd think the power utility would subsidize the cable companies to get as many of these things installed as possible.</li> 
    <li>All told, the devices in the preceding table consume an amount of energy similar to a 75 watt incandescent light bulb being left on all the time.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>For the most part, these components are non-critical, and one could argue that some (e.g&nbsp; the stereo) should be connected to a power strip with an on/off button. This should not pose much of an inconvenience.&nbsp; However, it's a completely different story when it comes to the video components.&nbsp; When powered cycled, set top boxes take forever to reach full functionality as they reboot over the cable network.&nbsp; And televisions, if left untethered to electric power for too long, go through this whole channel search sequence when they're powered up.&nbsp; In short, when it comes to video, you're currently stuck with paying the hidden price of &quot;convenience&quot;.</p> 
  <p>For the computer nerd in us, here's a table comprising some of the computer/network-related components that are left on 24x7.</p> 
  <table height="200" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" width="625">

  <p>A decade ago, devices like those listed above were virtually non-existent in the home.&nbsp; So what's the cost of being Internet ready anytime, anywhere?&nbsp; About 40 watts all day and all night. Some final points:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>In general, carefully consider keeping around older gadgets.&nbsp; The circa 1990s devices definitely use more energy than their newer, more functional counterparts.</li> 
    <li>Notice no computers are included.&nbsp; You know you have more than one, some (present company included) have way more than one.&nbsp; Let's hope you're turning these off or at least putting them to sleep at night!<br /></li>

<p>It is fascinating data.  Still, if you have three TVs, two set-top boxes and three game consoles, I can think of at least 5 things to do to cut the vampire load at your house :)</p>

<p>Reading this a bit late, but thought you might want to know:<br/>
When Switzerland's Telco Swisscom started to roll out their first generation DVR/IPTV solution to customers, it drew so much power (even when not running) that critics quickly calculated that if people would actually buy and use that device in large numbers (like TVs or old-school VCRs), there would simply be not enough power in Switzerland's electrical grid to make them run all day.<br/>
It would cost maybe a dollar or two to fit every &quot;TV&quot; with a little flash storage to make the configuration persistent. Then you could power it off completely when you don't need it. It works for wireless routers, so why not in every other device?<br/>
Imagine if you would need to have your car sort-of-running all the time because it would lose some of its &quot;configuration&quot; otherwise.</p>

<p>The table of consumption is quite unexpected, especially for the sub. What would need the power for this?</p>

<p>Thanks for the measurements. We too were surprised when we started to measure, I am currently having trouble getting my house below 250W at idle.</p>


<p>For my audio equipment attached to my TV I use one of these Eon power Switches:<br/>
www.eonenergy.com/At-Home/Going-Green/Energy-Saving-Advice/Interactive-House/Resource-Centre/resource-centre-powerdown.htm</p>


<p>When I put my TV into standby the Sub and Amp have their mains power completely removed.</p>


<p>I am working in reducing the number of DC power supplies, and also consolidation of data onto a single NAS disk (with a single backup) rather than the various 250/320 disks that have built up in my machines over the years.</p>


<p>I was considering changing my two network switches in the attic to one FS116 which is what brought me to your page. Surprisingly most switch documentation gives no indication of operational power used!</p>

<p>
Sun recently announced the availability of a second edition of its Java Real-Time System (Java RTS) version 2.2 Early Access.&nbsp; In a <a href="/jtc/entry/early_access_version_of_java">previous blog post</a>, many of the important new features of this release were highlighted.&nbsp; But I felt compelled to jot down a few additional words, not only because there's a newer version of the software to evaluate, but because there's one interesting component that deserves a little more exposure.</p> 
  <p>I spent some time today speaking with my compadre, Eric Bruno, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Java-Programming-RTS/dp/0137142986/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1251922771&amp;sr=8-2"><i><b>Real-Time Java Programming: With Java RTS</b></i></a>.&nbsp; He clued me in on the fact that our engineers have performed the daunting task of backporting the JDK 7 client compiler onto Java RTS 2.2.&nbsp; The engineering team is particularly proud of this feat, and ought to be.&nbsp; It not only enhances Java RTS performance, it also enables them to better stay in lock step with the latest client hotspot VM developments, something the latest Java SE 6 releases may not entirely do.&nbsp; For some insight into the engineering trade-offs associated creating this latest version of Java RTS, check out <a href="/roland/entry/64_bit_java_rts">Roland Westerlin's entry</a>.<br /></p> 
  <p>You can find further information about Java RTS <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/index.jsp">here</a>.&nbsp; And you can download a version of the software for evaluation <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/rts/">here</a>.</p>

TITLE: JavaFX Scenegraph Performance Revisited

BODY: 
<p> </p> 
  <p>Prior to the release of JavaFX 1.2, an <a href="/jtc/entry/node_count_and_javafx_performance">earlier blog post</a> explained how creating an application with a scenegraph containing a large number of nodes can have performance implications.&nbsp; That entry was subsequently picked up by <a href="http://java.dzone.com/">Java Lobby</a> and recently posted <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/node-count-and-javafx">here</a>.&nbsp; Partly because it was a few months old, it resulted in a rash of, shall we say, interesting comments.</p> 
  <p>As one commenter pointed out, the initial results represent JavaFX performance in the 1.0/1.1 timeframe.&nbsp; JavaFX 1.2 has since been released, and performance has improved substantially.&nbsp; As a case in point, you can click on the image below to run the clock application.&nbsp; This same application, developed and compiled with JavaFX 1.1 can be run from the previous blog post.&nbsp; Further instructions are <a href="/jtc/entry/node_count_and_javafx_performance">there</a>.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p><a href="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf-2/Digits.jnlp"><img src="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf-2/BulbClockNode.jpg" /></a></p> 
  <p>This application, compiled with JavaFX 1.2 and run on identical hardware,
uses about a third of the CPU resources of the original version.&nbsp; Specifically, using OpenSolaris <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/vmstat-1m?l=ru&amp;a=view">vmstat(1M)</a> to monitor CPU usage, the following average statistics were collected for one minute when the clock display is updated every 10th of a second.&nbsp; The abbreviations have the following meanings:<br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>us</b> = percentage usage of CPU time in <i>user</i> space<br /></li> 
    <li><b>sy</b> = percentage usage of CPU time in <i>system</i> space<br /></li> 
    <li><b>id</b> = percentage usage of CPU time idling</li> 
    <li>The sum of (us + sy + id) should approximate 100%. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>And here are the utilization numbers:</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" style="width: 100%;"> 
    <tbody> 
      <tr> 
        <td align="center"><b>&nbsp;Version</b></td> 
        <td align="center"><b>&nbsp;# Nodes per Digit<br /></b></td> 
        <td align="center"><b>&nbsp;CPU Utilization<br /></b></td> 
      </tr> 
      <tr> 
        <td>&nbsp;BulbClockNode JavaFX 1.1<br /></td> 
        <td>&nbsp;27 BulbNodes<br /></td> 
        <td>&nbsp;us: 22%&nbsp; sy: 2%&nbsp; id: 76%</td> 
      </tr> 
      <tr> 
        <td>&nbsp;BulbClockNode JavaFX 1.2</td> 
        <td>&nbsp;27 BulbNodes</td> 
        <td>&nbsp;us: 7%&nbsp; sy: 2%&nbsp; id: 91%</td> 
      </tr> 
    </tbody> 
  </table><br />Yes,&nbsp; performance has improved significantly and will continue to do so.&nbsp; In fact, the JavaFX team is promising even better results with the advent of JavaFX 1.3 (code named SoMa), when considerable refining of the underlying architecture will take place.&nbsp; At this stage in it's lifecycle, it's important to &quot;subscribe&quot; to the JavaFX technology.&nbsp; Advances are coming fast and furious, and they don't promise to slow down anytime soon.<br />

BODY: 
<p>In a <a href="/jtc/entry/avoiding_unnecessary_bindstorms">previous post</a>, I showed one way in which you could size the nodes in your scenegraph relative to the screen size without having to use binding, thus eliminating the potential for a <a href="/jtc/entry/avoiding_unnecessary_bindstorms">bindstorm</a>.&nbsp; At the time, the suggestion was to get the screen coordiantes via a call to AWT (Advanced Windowing Toolkit) as follows:</p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">var AWTtoolkit = java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit ();</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);"> var screenSizeFromAWT = AWTtoolkit.getScreenSize ();</span>
</pre> 
  <p> This currently works for JavaFX Desktop deployments but is far from an optimal solution primarily because it is non-portable.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that AWT will exist-- in fact I'm pretty sure it will not exist -- in the JavaFX Mobile and JavaFX TV space.&nbsp; So attempting to utilize the code snippet above in a JavaFX Mobile or TV context will result in an error.&nbsp; Unfortunately at the time of the original post (Java FX 1.1), I didn't know of a better alternative.</p> 
  <p>With the advent of JavaFX 1.2, this problem is solved.&nbsp;&nbsp; A new class called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">javafx.Stage.Screen</font>&nbsp; is provided which describes the characteristics of the display.&nbsp; The API definition of the class can be found <a href="http://java.sun.com/javafx/1.2/docs/api/javafx.stage/javafx.stage.Screen.html">here</a>.&nbsp; So now you can query the JavaFX runtime in a portable fashion to get the screen coordinates as follows:</p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;<code style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);"><b>import</b> javafx.stage.\*;
 //set Stage boundaries to consume entire screen
 Stage {</code><p><code style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">     fullscreen: true
     width: <a href="http://Screen.primary.bounds.minX">Screen.primary.bounds.minX</a>  as Integer
     height: <a href="http://Screen.primary.bounds.minY">Screen.primary.bounds.minY</a>  as Integer
     <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span></code><code style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">
 }</code>

</p><p>&nbsp;Cheers.

<p> Since the beginning, the deadlines set forth for producing our <a href="http://jfxbook.com">book</a> have been aggressive to say the least.&nbsp; Ultimately, we wanted them to be physically available for sale at the JavaOne 2009 conference.&nbsp; These things arrived literally hot off the press, having been flown in the opening day of the show.&nbsp; This effort was not in vain; the results are in.&nbsp; According to our friends at Digital Guru, JavaFX was definitely the hot topic of the week and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaFX-Developing-Rich-Internet-Applications/dp/013701287X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244432995&amp;sr=1-3"><i>JavaFX - Developing Rich Internet Applications</i></a> was the best seller.&nbsp; Furthermore as of 9:52AM Eastern Time 09-June-2009, Amazon reports that its sales rank is a very respectable 21,873.&nbsp; Not bad for just a few days showing.<br /></p> 
  <p><img src="/jtc/resource/javafx-book/front-cover.jpg" style="width: 201px; height: 268px;" /></p> 
  <p>These sales were no doubt fueled by Larry Ellison's cameo appearance during the first JavaOne keynote.&nbsp; Clearly hampered by what he could and could not say due to Oracle's pending acquisition of Sun, Larry went out of his way to promote the future of JavaFX.&nbsp; He must have mentioned it a half dozen times during his 10 minute or so appearance.&nbsp; On behalf of Eric and the other Jim, thanks bud.<br /></p>

BODY: 
<p>So you may ask, what effect does the food we eat have on our blood pressure?&nbsp; My experience, documented below, won't likely hold up to whole lot of scientific scrutiny, but it's good enough lesson for me.</p> 
  <p>A combination of poor eating habits and genetics lands me in that ever-increasing group of individuals who have high blood pressure.&nbsp; At first I was what you might consider borderline hypertensive.&nbsp; Being thin and active, in conjunction with my doctor, we only monitored my levels to make sure they didn't get worse.&nbsp; Unfortunately they did.</p> 
  <p>In an attempt at avoiding medication, I started seriously watching my sodium intake.&nbsp; The resulting change in blood pressure was noticeable in pretty short order.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the table below for daily readings for the last two weeks.&nbsp; In general, I try to take my reading at or around 8:00AM if possible.</p> 
  <p>Having spent my whole life eating pretty much what I please, it's not easy to make this lifestyle change.&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the help of loved ones, things have been going quite well.&nbsp; But then came Mother's day (5/10).&nbsp;&nbsp; A combination of brunch with my parents and dinner with my in-laws put the kabash on any diet plans.&nbsp; I knew this would happen, and was frankly looking forward to the feast.&nbsp; It only took one day for my pressure to skyrocket.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; But man did I enjoy eating the waffles, bacon, crumbcake, bagels, Mimosas (Orange Juice and Champagne) cookies, macaroni, meatballs, turkey, chocoloate cake, Coke, Espresso, wine, Sambuca and Cognac to name a few.<br /></p>

TITLE: Node Count and JavaFX Performance

<p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>In a recent blog entry entitled <a href="/michaelheinrichs/entry/best_practices_for_javafx_mobile1">Best Practices for JavaFX Mobile Applications (Part 2)</a>, Michael Heinrichs espouses that keeping the scenegraph as small as possible helps JavaFX applications perform optimally. Regardless what version of JavaFX you're using, this is sage advice.&nbsp; Having spent some time trying to create components for a scoreboard-like application, I was concerned over the amount of CPU time being consumed by the clock component pictured directly below.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><a href="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf/BulbClockNode.jnlp"><img src="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf/BulbClockNode.jpg" /></a><br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>You can click on the preceding image to run this mini application via Java WebStart.&nbsp;&nbsp; By placing your mouse over any of the digits and typing in, via keyboard input, a valid number, you can set the clock.&nbsp; Clicking on the &quot;START/STOP&quot; text will toggle the clock on and off.&nbsp; Like many scoreboard clocks, when the time remaining is less than one minute, 10ths of seconds are displayed.&nbsp; It is during this phase, when digits are being updated every tenth of a second, that this application can be especially taxing.&nbsp; You can imagine how troublesome this clock might be if it were to be part of say a hockey scoreboard which could have an additional 4 penalty clocks ticking simultaneously.</p> 
  <p>The major factor affecting performance appears to be the sheer number of nodes in the scenegraph that require recalculation for every clock tick.&nbsp; For this first implementation, each of the five clock digits is comprised of 27 <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">BulbNode</font>s, (my naming) which are switched on or off depending upon what value needs to be displayed.</p> 
  <p>In an effort to see how decreasing the node count might effect
performance, this second implementation of the clock component uses the
same underlying framework, except that each digit is now composed of 7
LED <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SegmentNode</font>s (my naming again) instead of 27 <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">BulbNode</font>s. &nbsp; You can run this version of the clock component by clicking on the image that follows.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <div style="text-align: left;" id="BulbClockNodeApplet"><a href="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf/LEDClockNode.jnlp"><img src="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf/LEDClockNode.jpg" /><br /></a></div> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>For our final example, in order to truly minimize node count, each digit is represented by a single <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">ImageView</font> node. When the value of a digit changes, a new <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Image</font>
is displayed.&nbsp; By caching all of the possible digit values (blank, 0-9)
you can very quickly switch images.&nbsp; No doubt, prettier images can be created, but I think you get the point.&nbsp; Click on the image that follows to try this version.<br /></p> 
  <p><a href="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf/ImageClockNode.jnlp"><img src="/jtc/resource/javafx-node-perf/ImageClockNode.jpg" /></a><br /></p> 
  <p><font size="3"><b>The Results</b></font></p> 
  <p>The slower the compute platform, the more pronounced the differences in performance should be.&nbsp; Thinking along those lines, a very modest 1.4 GHz Pentium M laptop was chosen as the test environment to compare CPU utilization for these applications.&nbsp; OpenSolaris provides an easy-to-use well-known command-line tool called <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/vmstat-1m?l=ru&amp;a=view">vmstat(1M)</a>, which was chosen as the mechanism to analyze the individual applications. In contrast, the Performance Tab which is part of the Windows Task Manager, seemed to produce wild performance variations.<br /></p> 
  <p>For each run,&nbsp; the clocks were set to one minute, and run until the time expired.&nbsp; The data shown below represents the average CPU utilization, after startup, for each of the three implementations.&nbsp; In particular we'll look at the following fields returned by <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">vmstat</font>:<br /> </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>us</b> - percentage usage of CPU time in <i>user</i> space<br /></li> 
    <li><b>sy</b> - percentage usage of CPU time in <i>system</i> space<br /></li> 
    <li><b>id</b> - percentage usage of CPU time idling</li> 
  </ul> The sum of (us + sy + id) should approximate 100%.

<p>One point: you may want to try your experiment on a system with better video board (relatively recent nvidia or ATI). On your machine with integrated adapter everything would have been ran in sw, no hw acceleration.</p>

<p>As per these first two comments:</p>


<p>(1) Dmitri suggests running on better hardware taking advantage of hardware accelerated graphics.  This will absolutely help.  What I was interested in pointing out though is that resource challenged devices (i.e. JavaFX mobile?)  might have issues with this, thus the usage of the older system.</p>


<p>(2) Problems running applications on linux.  Yeah, I've seen all types of wierdness on both Linux and OpenSolaris, depending upon all sorts of variables, including JRE version and hardware graphics capabilities.  The unfortunate reality right now is that your best bet is to stick with either Windows or MacOS.  </p>

Today truly marks a milestone in the history of Solaris for the x86/x64 platform.&nbsp; One of the most ubiquitous applications, Adobe Reader (notably Acrobat), is now available on [Open]Solaris for both Sparc and x86.</p> 
  <p>It's been a long time coming, one argument for the lack of Solaris x86 support till now was that [Open]Solaris didn't have the critical mass.&nbsp; That's a hard one to swallow for the following reasons:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>There's been a Solaris Sparc version for a long time.&nbsp; Solaris x86 downloads outnumber Sparc downloads by a large factor.</li> 
    <li>Versions for AIX and HP-UX, which have a significantly smaller installed base, are available.&nbsp; Maybe IBM and HP payed a lot of money for this?</li> 
    <li>Until recently there were versions even for the likes of OS/2 and UnixWare.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Perhaps <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evince/">open source alternatives</a> are becoming good enough to pose a threat?&nbsp; Whatever the reason, we welcome the arrival of Acrobat Reader and Adobe's change of heart.</p>

<p>It is within our nature, even in the most infinitesimal way, to leave our mark on this world before we exit it.&nbsp; I'd like to coin the following term, heretofore unseen in the JavaFX space, and submit it as my humble contribution to the human collective:</p> 
  <p><b>bindstorm</b> \\'bïnd•storm\\ (noun): condition where a multitude of JavaFX bind recalculations severely hampers interactive performance</p> 
  <p>Yeah, I know, using the word you wish to define inside its definition is bad, but there is precedent for this: (1) Fancy-schmancy, hoity-toity college dictionaries do it all the time. (2) Mathematicians and computer scientists call this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>: that mysterious concept which developers use to impress others of their programming prowess.<br /></p> 
  <p>Don't get me wrong, JavaFX binding is incredibly powerful.&nbsp; Heck, we dedicated a whole chapter to it in our soon-to-be-released book <a href="jfxbook.com">JavaFX: Developing Rich Internet Applications</a>.&nbsp; But binding does come with a price, and like most anything else, over-consumption can lead to abuse.</p> 
  <p>Consider this use case: you've got a JavaFX application with dozens or maybe even hundreds of <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Node</font>s that are part of the scenegraph.&nbsp; Each of the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Node</font>s are ultimately sized and positioned in proportion to <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">height</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">width</font> instance variables that are passed on down.&nbsp; If you define <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">width</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">height</font> at startup and have no interest in a resizeable interface, then you stand a good chance of avoiding the use of many <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">bind</font> expressions.&nbsp; The one potential twist here is that if you're sincerely interested in a non-resizeable application, but want it to consume the entire screen, what do you do?&nbsp; As screens come in all shapes and sizes, you may not know what the resolution is at start time.&nbsp; JavaFX has an elegant solution for this which uses <i>binding</i>.</p> 
  <p>Here's a simple application which defines a <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Rectangle</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Circle</font> that fill the entire screen.&nbsp; You can click anywhere within the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Circle</font> to exit the application.&nbsp; Notice the number of <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">bind</font>s required to get this to work.<br /></p>

  <p>Imagine what this would look like if you had lots of complex custom components with many more dependencies on <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">height</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">width</font>.&nbsp; In addition to the potential performance impact, this could be error-prone and cumbersome to code.&nbsp; To avoid the over usage of binding and the potential for a <i>bindstorm</i>, applications of this sort could be re-written as follows:</p> 
  <pre>import javafx.stage.\*;
import javafx.scene.\*;
import javafx.scene.shape.\*;
import javafx.scene.paint.\*;
import javafx.scene.input.\*;

function run() : Void {
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">var AWTtoolkit = java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit ();</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">    var screenSizeFromAWT = AWTtoolkit.getScreenSize ();</span>
    Stage {
        fullScreen: true
        scene: Scene {
            content: [
                Rectangle {
                    width: <span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">screenSizeFromAWT.width</span>
                    height: <span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">screenSizeFromAWT.height</span>
                    fill: Color.BLUE
                }
                Circle {
                    centerX: <span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">screenSizeFromAWT.width / 2</span>
                    centerY: <span style="color: rgb(82, 0, 255);">screenSizeFromAWT.height / 2</span>
                    radius: <span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">if (screenSizeFromAWT.width &lt;</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">                        screenSizeFromAWT.height) then</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">                        screenSizeFromAWT.width / 2</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 3, 255);">                        else screenSizeFromAWT.height / 2</span>
                    fill: Color.RED
                    onMouseClicked: function(me: MouseEvent) {
                        FX.exit();
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

</pre> 
  <p>We achieve the same effect as the first example by first making a call to a method in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">java.awt.Toolkit</font> package.&nbsp; With this information we can statically define our scenegraph without the use of binding.</p> 
  <p>There is one caveat to this solution.&nbsp; As the AWT (Advanced Windowing Toolkit) is an integral part of Java SE, this code should be portable across all JavaFX desktops.&nbsp; However, if you wish to deploy a JavaFX Mobile solution, the AWT calls would likely change.&nbsp; Is there a mechanism that might work across both models?</p> 
  <p>As a final thought, while we're on this theme of coining terms, my compadres <a href="/clarkeman/">Jim Clarke</a> and <a href="http://www.ericbruno.com/">Eric Bruno</a>, co-authors of the <a href="http://jfxbook.com">aforementioned JavaFX book</a>, jokingly asked what word could be used to describe this scenario:</p> 
  <p>
&quot;Condition where binds lead to binds that leads back to the original bind, ending up in a Stack fault?&quot;<br /> <br />BindQuake? BindTsunami? Bindless? BindSpin? BindHole (BlackHole)? BindPit? <br /></p>

TITLE: Registering Multiple Actions (or Handlers) in JavaFX
DATE: 02/24/2009 06:38:34
PRIMARY CATEGORY: Sun

BODY: 
<p>Java developers, especially those performing any type of GUI work, will ultimately encounter Java's event-driven programming paradigm.&nbsp; In short, if programmers want to act upon some kind of event they bundle up a chunk of code into a Java method, typically referred to as a handler, and register the handler with that event.&nbsp; Whenever that event occurs, the handler code will automatically be executed.<br /></p> 
  <p>JavaFX provides a similar mechanism.&nbsp; For a straightforward example, the code below defines a simple timer in JavaFX with a resolution of 1 second.&nbsp; Each time a second expires, the function specified by the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">action</font> instance variable will be executed.&nbsp; Here's what it looks like:</p> 
  <pre>import javafx.animation.\*;

public class SimpleTimer {
    public def timeline = Timeline {
        repeatCount: 5
        interpolate: false
        keyFrames: [
            KeyFrame {
                time: 1s
                <b>action: function () : Void {
                    println("tick");
                }</b>
            }
        ]
    }
}

</pre> 
  <p>Adding a <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">run()</font> function, as follows, to the bottom of this source will enable you run an instance of this timer:</p> 
  <pre>function run() : Void {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var s = SimpleTimer{};
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.timeline.playFromStart();
} 
</pre> 
  <p>The output from this run looks like this:<br /></p> 
  <pre>tick
tick
tick
tict
tick 
</pre> 
  <p>It's all well and good if you only need a single action.&nbsp; What if you wanted to perform multiple actions and/or dynamically add or subtract a number of actions?&nbsp; We can enhance our previous <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SimpleTimer</font> class to dynamically register and unregister handlers by taking advantage of two of JavaFX's features: <i>sequences</i> and <i>function pointers</i>.</p> 
  <p>Our new class provides more flexibility:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>It defines an instance variable called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">duration</font>, which enables the user to specify the resolution of a clock tick at object instantiation.<br /></li> 
    <li>It defines two additional public functions called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">registerHandler()</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">unRegisterHandler()</font>
which take a function pointer (a handler) as an argument.&nbsp; By registering a
handler, the function will be included in the list of handlers to be
executed each time the specified duration expires.</li> 
    <li>A handler is registered by inserting it's function pointer argument into an internal sequence of function pointers called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">handlers[]</font>.</li> 
    <li>A handler is similarly unregistered by deleting it's function pointer argument from the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">handlers[]</font> sequence.</li> 
    <li>The action instance variable, which is part of the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">KeyFrame</font> instance, now calls an internal function called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">runHandlers()</font>.&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">runHandlers()</font> sequentially executes the functions found in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">handlers[]</font> sequence.</li> 
  </ul>Here's the new class:<br /> 
  <pre>import javafx.animation.\*;

public class Timer {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /\*\*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* User-definable:&nbsp; specifies the length of time for one cycle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \*/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public var duration = 100ms;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public def timeline = Timeline {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeatCount: Timeline.INDEFINITE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpolate: false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keyFrames: [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KeyFrame {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time: duration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>action: runHandlers</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Holds the list of handlers to run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected var handlers: function() [];

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /\*\*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* Add the function, represented by the handler argument, to the list
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* of handlers.&nbsp; These will run when the elapsed time, specified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* by the duration instance variable, expires.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \*/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public function registerHandler(handler : function()) : Void {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (func in handlers) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (handler == func) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;&nbsp; // handler already registered -- skip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insert handler into handlers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /\*\*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* Remove the function, represented by the handler argument, from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* the list of handlers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \*/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public function unRegisterHandler(handler : function()) : Void {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delete handler from handlers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected function runHandlers() : Void {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (handler in handlers) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handler();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
} 
</pre> 
  <p>To test this class out, we'll add a <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">run()</font> function at the script level.&nbsp; The <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">run()</font> function creates a <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Timer</font> instance and registers two handler functions, <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">decrementTenthsRemaining()</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">processTicks()</font>.&nbsp; Here's the code:</p> 
  <pre>function run() : Void {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var t = Timer {};
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var tenthsRemaining = 100;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var decrementTenthsRemaining = function() : Void {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tenthsRemaining -= 1;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var processTick = function() : Void {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (tenthsRemaining mod 10 == 0) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println("seconds left: {tenthsRemaining / 10}");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (tenthsRemaining == 0) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.timeline.stop();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.registerHandler(decrementTenthsRemaining);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.registerHandler(processTick);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.timeline.play();
}</pre> 
  <p>And this is the output from the run:<br /></p> 
  <pre>seconds left: 9
seconds left: 8
seconds left: 7
seconds left: 6
seconds left: 5
seconds left: 4
seconds left: 3
seconds left: 2
seconds left: 1
seconds left: 0</pre>

TITLE: Overhead in Increasing the Solaris System Clock Rate 
DATE: 01/14/2009 06:48:39

BODY: 
<p>
In a previous entry entitled <a href="/jtc/entry/real_time_java_and_high">Real-Time Java and High Resolution Timers</a>, we discussed how Sun's Java Real-Time System requires access to timers with a resolution greater than the default 10ms to do anything really interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also stated that most modern processors have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APIC">APIC or Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller</a> which supports much finer-grained clock tick rates.</p> 
  <p>Unfortunately there are many instances where a system does indeed contain an APIC, but it is not exposed by the BIOS.&nbsp; Furthermore, we've found that some of the embedded, low-power x86-based processors do not contain an APIC at all.&nbsp; For an example, take a look at the AMD Geode LX 800 based <a href="/jtc/entry/opensolaris_on_the_smallest_system">fit-PC Slim</a>.<br /></p> 
  <p>So if you wanted to utilize higher resolution timers for this class of system, you'd have to resort to alternative methods.&nbsp; Solaris and OpenSolaris provide two <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/etc/system</font> parameters called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">hires_tick </font>and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">hires_hz</font> to facilitate increasing your default system clock tick.&nbsp; By adding the following line to <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/etc/system</font>, you'll increase the system clock tick rate from the default of 100 per second to 1,000 per second, effectively changing the clock resolution from 10ms to 1ms.</p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; set hires_tick=1</pre> 
  <p>If you want to further increase the clock resolution, you can do so via the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">hires_hz</font> system tunable parameter.&nbsp; Although formally unsupported, it does work.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to, for example, increase the clock tick rate to 10,000, add this to <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/etc/system</font>:</p> 
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">set hires_tick=1
    set hires_hz=10000</font></pre> 
  <p>To achieve the desired effect above, you must include both the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">hires_tick</font> assignment in addition to setting the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">hires_hz</font> parameter.</p> 
  <p>These modifications do not come without side-effects, and depending upon the hardware in question and the granularity of the desired timer resolution, they could be significant.&nbsp; In short, it takes additional CPU cycles to field all those timer interrupts.&nbsp; So I thought it'd be interesting to see what effect changing the clock tick rate had on two separate systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here they are:</p>

  <p>The measuring tool used for this simple experiment is <font face="courier new,courier,monospace"><a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/vmstat-1m?l=en&amp;a=view">vmstat(1m)</a></font>.&nbsp; Solaris aficionados will likely point out that there are much more accurate alternatives, but I think <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">vmstat(1m)</font> gives a decent feel for what's going on without having to expend a whole lot of extra energy.&nbsp; In particular we'll look at the following fields returned by issuing a '<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">vmstat 5</font>', and picking one of the interim samples:<br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>in</b> - interrupts per second</li> 
    <li><b>us</b> - percentage usage of CPU time in <i>user</i> space<br /></li> 
    <li><b>sy</b> - percentage usage of CPU time in <i>system</i> space<br /></li> 
    <li><b>id</b> - percentage usage of CPU time idling</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The sum of (us + sy + id) should approximate 100%. &nbsp;The table below shows sample vmstat output on various clock tick settings for our two hardware platforms. <br /></p>

  <p>Notes/Conclusions:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The vmstat(5) was let run for about a minute.&nbsp; The output above shows one of the typical 5 second samples.&nbsp; The other 5 second samples are almost identical.<br /></li> 
    <li>The user (us) CPU time numbers give us a reasonable idea that these
systems were predominantly in an idle state when being sampled.</li> 
    <li>The number of interrupts serviced per second is directly proportional to the clock tick rate.</li> 
    <li>And of course, the larger the number of interrupts, the more system CPU time is required.</li> 
    <li>The amount of overhead taken up by increasing the clock rate is a function of system capability.&nbsp; The CF-30 not only has a much faster processor, it also has two cores to share the interrupt load.&nbsp; As such it could accommodate a much higher clock tick rate.&nbsp; For the fit-PC, performance is impacted profoundly even at modest clock tick rates.<br /></li>

BODY: 
<p>This week marks the <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/features/2008-1204/index.jsp">formal release of JavaFX 1.0</a>.&nbsp; During the interval between the early marketing blitz and now, we've heard a lot from our friends in the press and the blogosphere, and in many instances what they had to say was not very pretty.&nbsp; Some think the <i>Rich Internet Application</i> platform battle lines are already drawn between Adobe and Microsoft, and dismiss Sun as having arrived too late to the party.&nbsp; Others opine that JavaFX's underlying Java platform is so yesterday.&nbsp; In fact Java is the primary reason why JavaFX will, much to the chagrin of many, receive serious consideration.&nbsp; Here's why:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>Java is ubiquitous</b>.&nbsp; It is the proven, de-facto platform for web-based deployment.&nbsp; On the desktop, it is estimated that approximately 90% of PCs have Java installed. In fact the major PC OEMs have seen fit to install it for you out of the box.&nbsp; In the mobile world, Java is the dominant deployment platform.&nbsp; Billions (that's with a 'b') of devices run Java. <br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>The Java development community is arguably the largest on the planet</b>.&nbsp; Java gained initial widespread acclaim as a productive development environment, and continues to do so.&nbsp; As JavaFX is an evolution of Java and seamlessly integrates with it, human nature tells us that individuals will naturally want to work with and leverage that which they already know and are familiar with.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>Alternatives are still no match for the Java Virtual Machine</b>.&nbsp; It has been extensively studied, vetted, scrutinized, poked, prodded, abused, cloned, and optimized more than any other virtual machine in the history of computing. And just in case you're under the impression that the Java Virtual Machine is limited only to the Java (and now JavaFX script) programming languages, think again.&nbsp; At last count there were over 200 projects integrating modern dynamic languages to the Java VM.&nbsp; That list includes the usual suspects like PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Python, and [insert your favorite language here]. <br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
    <li><b>The amount of Java Standard Edition online updates is staggering</b>.&nbsp; We know.&nbsp; We supply the downloads.&nbsp; And once a desktop is upgraded, it will be able to take full advantage of the features JavaFX brings to the table, effectively trivializing the barriers to entry.</li> 
  </ul>Many of our most talented folks have been working feverishly to reach this milestone.&nbsp; That being said, there's still lot's more work to do.&nbsp; But we're off to a real nice start.&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://javafx.com">http://javafx.com</a>.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; looks like the site is a little sluggish right now.&nbsp; Maybe we underestimated all the interest?<br />

<p>J Marinacci is the embodiment of what is wrong with Sun: brilliant technologies at the hands of people that wreck them. </p>


<p>Today's failure of the launch is abysmal and unacceptable. </p>


<p>This is the case about Sun. Everything thrown at the end user (the PR you might say) is incredibly miserable.</p>


<p>The JavaFX website was a failure. The use of quicktime was a bad choice and many others. Does Sun know any good designers in town? </p>


<p>Please tell J Marinacci is better suited somewhere else. Maybe a higher postion somewhere.</p>

<p>In that case they changed it. The JavaFX website uses (or used, but not the last time I checked it) Flash instead of Java applets.</p>


<p>That alone is enough to drive people away from applets. If even Sun doesn't use them, there must be something fundamentally wrong with them.</p>

<p>The simple reason Sun does not use JavaFX for their videos is that it is too slow. Nobody has enough patience to wait for around 2-3 min it takes to download. At first I thought it was just that the JFX libraries need to be loaded for the first time. But, for every demo, it is the case. Safari even complains about it! Really, they have not even done preliminary testing on this stuff.</p>

<p>And I simply can't imagine why they don't have a progress bar instead of the Java icon. Even kids nowadays know that it is better to have a progress (even if it is a dummy) bar to keep the user interested.</p>

<p>None of your 'reasons' amount to a hill of beans, unfortunately.  Sure lots of people use Java, but not the people who write the sort of applications that JavaFX is targetted at.  They all use Flash, and they're not going to change now.  Even Silverlight is pretty much doomed already.</p>

<p>I read it but could not notice the advantages of JavaFX</p>


<p>May be its the fact that it can be used on Desktop. </p>


<p>But Anything that takes forever to load is inherently doomed on INTERNET.</p>

<p>You'll have to install the JavaFX SDK or get the FX Runtime installed in your machine prior running any JavaFX application on your desktop.</p>


<p>They should have bundle that into the JDK to avoid so many downloads.</p>

<p>Not so.  If you download a recent JRE, the JavaFX runtime is included.  To give you an idea, since its announcement, there have been 100 million JRE updates, each with support for JavaFX.  </p>

<p>Javafx site is hopeless. How come such a poorly tested application can go to public? Loading time is awful. When sun wants to compete with Flash, they should at least match performance with Flash. Sun should learn from MS on C# first release. I am big java fan, sun let me down again.</p>

<p>One of my compadres forwarded me this <a title="link" href="http://www.fit-pc.com/">link</a> from CompuLab, an Israeli company which has created this real small, very energy efficient PC.&nbsp; It may just be the smallest full-featured system to date.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><img width="362" height="335" src="/jtc/resource/fitpc/500_keys.jpg" /> </p>  I'm a sucker for these types of things, and thought it would be interesting to get a reduced footprint version of OpenSolaris up and running on it.&nbsp; Haven't gotten around to playing with wi-fi, or for that matter the graphics (as the reduced footprint version of OpenSolaris has no windowing system), but every indication points to a system that doesn't require any magic incantations to get OpenSolaris up and running.&nbsp; Here are some of the specs<br /><br /> 
  <table border="0">

      </tr> 
    </tbody> 
  </table> 
  <p><br />The system has a serial port, and upon request, CompuLab will provide the required custom serial cable.&nbsp; By instructing <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/grub_boot_solaris.jsp">GRUB</a> to redirect the console to the serial port, you can connect the serial cable to another system and communicate directly with the console.&nbsp; To get a rough idea of how to accomplish this, check <a href="/jtc/entry/enabling_remote_mdb_debugging_of">here</a>.&nbsp; The screenshots below show that from an OpenSolaris terminal window, you can use the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5165/tip-1?a=view"><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">tip(1)</font></a> command to accomplish this.<br /></p> 
  <p>So the question is, how minimal is this configuration?&nbsp; Issuing `<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">ps -ef</font>' shows that only 14 processes are currently running, of which I'm sure there's an opportunity to eliminate one or two if need be.</p> 
  <p><img src="/jtc/resource/fitpc/ps-ef.jpg" /></p> 
  <p>To give you an idea of how much RAM is currently consumed, here's what issuing the 'memstat' macro under <font face="courier new,courier,monospace"><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/mdb/">mdb(1m)</a></font> yields:</p>

<p>
A veteran Java ONE keynote presenter, <a href="http://www.perronerobotics.com/">Perrone Robotics</a> has developed some real interesting technologies which take the concept of using autonomous (i.e. unmanned) vehicles to a whole new level.&nbsp; One of their key ingredients is the MAX software platform which utilizes common commercially available components to enable Perrone to very quickly and cost-effectively retrofit nearly any vehicle in short order.</p> 
  <p><img src="http://www.perronerobotics.com/files/images/JavaOneUAV.png" /> <br /></p> 
  <p>The MAX robotics platform runs on a (roughly 4&quot; x 6&quot;) low-power PC board atop Solaris and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/">Sun's Java Real-Time System (Java RTS)</a>.&nbsp; This combination gives Perrone the ability to leverage the huge Java development community, and assures that their critical software components behave in a predictable and deterministic fashion.</p> 
  <p>During the Java ONE 2007 conference, I was speaking with Paul Perrone about the notion of creating a <a href="/jtc/entry/framework_to_help_create_small">minimized version of Solaris</a> over which his platform might run.&nbsp; The helicopter pictured above, boots from a relatively small (4-8Gb)&nbsp; IDE flash drive, where standard Solaris takes up a substantial chunk.&nbsp; It leaves them precious little space to collect valuable information like telemetry or terrain data.&nbsp; Paul asked to revist this idea for a future project.&nbsp; That's where we left off.</p> 
  <p>Not that we've ignored them since, but it wasn't until a year later that small Solaris reared its head again.&nbsp; In addition to saving space, their main interest in this environment was in seeing <i>how much faster Solaris might boot up</i>.&nbsp; The ability to be fully functional from power-up in as short a time as possible is of critical importance.</p> 
  <p>So before investigating what advantages there might be, let's provide some background information:<br /><br /><b>Hardware<br /></b></p> 
  <p>Two separate systems were used, and for argument's sake, represent two ends of the x86 compute spectrum.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><b>Operating Systems</b></p> 
  <p>Minimal configurations were created for Solaris 10 08/07 (Update 4) and OpenSolaris Nevada build 93.&nbsp; These configurations boot entirely into RAM and consume less than 100MB ramdisk space.&nbsp; With a little more effort they can be may significantly smaller.&nbsp; The original blog post describing the environment is <a href="/jtc/entry/framework_to_help_create_small">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can download the framework for these hardware/OS combinations <a href="/jtc/resource/fast_boot_solaris/min_sol_framework.tar">here</a>, and can get a feel for the build environment by taking a look at this <a href="/jtc/resource/fast_boot_solaris/README.txt">README</a>.<br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><b>Definitions</b></p> 
  <p><b></b>Within the context of this discussion, here are the key terms along with their meanings.<br /> </p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><i>Total Boot Time</i></b>: This is the
time it takes from power-up till a user is prompted to log in.&nbsp;
Typically for a full Solaris installation, the windowing system must
first start up and present the user with a login screen.&nbsp; In a minimal
Solaris environment, there is no windowing system.&nbsp; Instead, the <i>total boot time</i> is defined as the time it takes from power-up till a user is prompted with the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">console login:</font> prompt.</p> 
    <p><i><b>POST Time</b></i>: POST or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test">Power On Self Test</a>
is the time taken by the system at pre-boot to handle things like
diagnostics,&nbsp; BIOS and device initialization.&nbsp; For this discussion,
we'll define <i>POST time</i> as the time it takes from power-up until the user is presented with a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a>
boot menu.&nbsp; We call out this segment of the total time because in many
cases we are at the mercy of the PC/BIOS manufacturer and can't overly
influence how quickly or slowly this proceeds.</p> 
    <p><i><b>Solaris Boot Time</b></i>:
The time it takes from being presented with a GRUB boot menu till a
Solaris user is prompted to log in.&nbsp; Again, depending upon whether a
windowing system is configured or not, this may represent the time it
takes to be prompted with a login screen or <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">console login:</font> prompt respectively.&nbsp; This represents the segment of time that we can influence.<br /></p> 
    <p>We can conclude from these definitions that: </p> 
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Boot Time</i> = <i>POST Time</i> + <i>Solaris Boot Time</i></p>

  <p><b>Conclusions/Notes</b></p> 
  <p>1. These times were taken by hand with the stopwatch feature on my Timex.&nbsp; If anything, the times might be slightly shorter than actually recorded as there is a human delay in reacting to seeing the necessary prompts.&nbsp; I ran the tests several times, and the same numbers consistently appear.<br /></p> 
  <p>2. The version of the OS appears to matter a lot, as OpenSolaris nvx_93 boots up nearly twice as fast as Solaris 10 U4 on the same hardware.</p> 
  <p>3. The type of I/O device subsystem seems to be a big factor too.&nbsp; For example, by switching out the IDE Flash Drive with a 5400 RPM IDE hard disk, i84810 total boot time decreased by about 6 seconds for both Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>4. The minimal Solaris environment is currently only available in 32-bit mode.<br /> </p> 
  <p>5. With relative ease, Solaris can be configured to boot in less that 10 seconds on modern x86 hardware.&nbsp; My unofficial record stands at 9 seconds (or slightly less).&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt it could boot faster on more robust hardware (eliminating POST time).&nbsp; Any takers?<br /></p>

<p>It might be worth taking a look at <a href="http://www.milax.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.milax.org/</a>  if you are interested in a mimimised version of OpenSolaris, it fits into 128Mb of flash, and runs in 128Mb of RAM if you just want command-line access.</p>

<p>I just updated the download for the framework.  Towards the goal of maximum simplicity and freedom, I've decided to license the scripts under the BSD license.  The download tarball now contains a LICENSE.txt file.</p>

BODY: 
<p>
As is often the case, Sun's technologies and offerings are being
applied in ways which we hadn't necessarily anticipated.&nbsp; Yet another
example has reared its head in the govenrment/military space where
customers have expressed interest in using Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/">Java Real-Time System </a>with <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/ds/trusted_extensions.jsp">Solaris Trusted Extensions</a>.&nbsp;
As it stands right now, Java RTS will neither operate nor install
within the confines of such an environment.&nbsp; Let's investigate why this
is so, and see what current opportunities there are for
working around this shortcoming.<br /> </p> 
  <p>So what is it that
causes Trusted Extensions and Java RTS not to play together nicely?&nbsp;&nbsp;
It happens to revolve around Trusted Extension's extensive usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Containers">Solaris zones</a>
to limit access between differing security levels.&nbsp; Solaris packages must be specifically configured to accommodate zones, which has yet to formally take place with Java RTS.&nbsp; As zones are a core
component of Solaris, we can, for the sake of simplicity, just use
standard Solaris to demonstrate how we can work around this temporary limitation.&nbsp; These modifications
should apply to Trusted Extensions just as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get Java RTS to work within a zone, follow these steps:<br /> </p> 
  <p>1. Install the Java RTS cyclic driver (only) in the global zone.<br /> </p> <span style="font-family: monospace;">global# <span style="font-weight: bold;">pkgadd -d . SUNWrtjc</span><br /> <br />

## Verifying disk space requirements.<br />
## Checking for conflicts with packages already installed.<br />
## Checking for setuid/setgid programs.<br /> <br />
This package contains scripts which will be executed with super-user<br />
permission during the process of installing this package.<br /> <br />
Do you want to continue with the installation of &lt;SUNWrtjc&gt; [y,n,?] y<br /> <br />
Installing Java Real-Time System cyclic driver as &lt;SUNWrtjc&gt;<br /> </span><br /> <br />
2. Create a zone called '<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">rtjzone</font>':<br /> 
  <pre>global# <b>mkdir -p /zone</b>
bash-3.00# <b>zonecfg -z rtjzone</b>
rtjzone: No such zone configured
Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.
zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <b>create</b>
zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <b>set zonepath=/zone/rtjzone</b>

zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <b>commit</b>

  <pre>global# <b>zoneadm list -vc</b>

The file &lt;/zone/rtjzone/root/var/sadm/system/logs/install_log&gt; contains a log of the zone installation.</pre> 
  <p><br />
3.&nbsp; Modify the zone to allow access to the cyclic device, and to allow additional privileges</p> 
  <pre>global# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zonecfg -z rtjzone</span>
zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set limitpriv=default,proc_priocntl,proc_lock_memory,proc_clock_highres</span>
zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">add device</span>
zonecfg:rtjzone:device&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set match=/dev/cyclic</span>
zonecfg:rtjzone:device&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span>
zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">verify</span>
zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">commit</span>
zonecfg:rtjzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">exit

</span>global#<span style="font-weight: bold;"> zoneadm -z rtjzone reboot
</span></pre>
Note:&nbsp; One privilege that is useful with Java RTS is <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">sys_res_config</font>.&nbsp;
This is typically used to assign a real-time process to a <a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/solaris_processor.html">processor set</a>.&nbsp;
Unfortunately zones cannot currently be given this privilege.&nbsp; You can
however, from the global zone, assign a processor set to a zone, which
might be a reasonable workaround.<br /> <br /> 
  <p>4.&nbsp; Get a copy of the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SUNWrtjv</font> package and modify it so
that it will install in a zone.&nbsp; The <a href="/jtc/resource/rts-zone/postinstall">postinstall</a> script and <a href="/jtc/resource/rts-zone/postremove">postremove</a>
script must replaced with those provided by these hyperlinks just
mentioned.<br /> </p> 
  <pre>rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd /scratch</span>
rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">ls</span>
SUNWrtjv	postinstall	postremove
rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cp postinstall SUNWrtjv/install/</span>
rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cp postremove SUNWrtjv/install/

</span></pre>
5. Modify the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SUNWrtjv pkgmap</font> file with the appropriate sizes,
checksums and last access dates.&nbsp; The source code for a sample C
program, called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">pkgmap_info</font>, which prints out the necessary information, can be found <a href="/jtc/resource/rts-zone/pkgmap_info.c">here</a>.<br /> <br /> 
  <pre>rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd SUNWrtjv</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">grep post pkgmap</span>
1 i postinstall 5402 42894 1194344457
1 i postremove 2966 34854 1194344457

rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cp pkgmap_info.c /tmp</span>
rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cc -o /tmp/pkgmap_info /tmp/pkgmap_info.c
</span>rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd /scratch/SUNWrtjv/install/
</span>rtjzone#<span style="font-weight: bold;"> /tmp/pkgmap_info postinstall
</span>postinstall 5820 9488 1213727841
rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">/tmp/pkgmap_info postremove
</span>postremove 3092 45039 1213727538<span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span>
</pre>
Replace the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">postinstall</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">postremove</font> entries in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">pkgmap</font> file with
those produced by the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">pkgmap_info</font> program.&nbsp; You cannot simply use the
example data above because the last access times will not match.&nbsp; Doing so will cause the install to fail.<br /> <br /> <br />
6. Install the Java RTS <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SUNWrtjv</font> package inside the zone.<br /> <br /> <span style="font-family: monospace;">rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd /scratch</span><br />
rtjzone# <span style="font-weight: bold;">pkgadd -d . SUNWrtjv</span><br /> <br />

Where should this package be installed? (/opt): <span style="font-weight: bold;">/opt</span><br /> <br />
To achieve predictable temporal behavior, the Java Real-Time System<br />
must be granted access to a number of privileged Solaris resources.<br />
By default, access to these privileged resources is only granted to<br />
the superuser (root). They can also be granted to additional users<br />
by creating a rights profile, that is, a collection of authorizations,<br />
that can later be assigned to an administrative role or directly<br />
to a user.<br /> <br />
As part of this package installation, a local 'Java Real-Time System User'<br />
rights profile can be created on this machine.<br />
This rights profile should NOT be created if such an action conflicts<br />
with your computer security management policies. If unsure, contact<br />
your system administrator or your computer security manager.<br />
Also refer to the product's release notes for further details regarding<br />
the privileges required by the Java Real-Time System.<br /> <br />

</pre>
We hope to more formally support Solaris zones
usage with Java RTS in the future.&nbsp; In the interim this workaround can help you get
started.&nbsp; Many thanks to Jim Clarke, who did the lion's share of the legwork to find this solution.<br />

BODY: 
<p>As memory access is typically orders of magnitude faster than disk access, the idea of using a part of RAM as an in-memory storage device has been one of the earliest performance optimizations realized by the computer science community.&nbsp; Even though today this type of optimization takes place transparently inside modern operating systems (via mechanisms like the disk buffer cache),&nbsp; there are still circumstances where manually creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_disk">RAM disk</a> might still be quite useful.<br /><br />A Solaris customer using the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/ramdiskadm-1m?l=ko&amp;a=view">ramdiskadm(1m)</a> utility to create a Ram disk device for a real-time application posed the following question: &quot;Are RAM disks swappable?&quot;. From a real-time perspective, a RAM disk not only yields significantly better seek performance but also provides for more deterministic behavior compared to the traditional rotating disk platter.&nbsp; The customer's concern here is that, under dire circumstances, is it possible for operating system swap out the RAM disk memory?&nbsp; Needless to say, if a swap out occurred it would put a big crimp in the real-time application's predictability.<br /></p><p>To get an idea of what's going on when a RAM disk is created, let's use the Solaris <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/kstat-1m?a=view">kstat(1m)</a> kernel statitics utility to see how memory is being allocated.&nbsp; First let's see what memory looks like before creating a RAM disk:</p><pre># <b>pagesize</b><br />4096<br /># <b>kstat -n system_pages | grep pagesfree</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pagesfree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 96334<br /># <b>kstat -n system_pages | grep pageslocke</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   pageslocked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26170
</pre><p>So, on this particular system, where a page is 4096 bytes,&nbsp; there are currently 96334 pages free, and 26170 pages that are locked.&nbsp; Now let's create a 50MB RAM disk:</p><pre># <b>ramdiskadm -a rd 50m</b><br />/dev/ramdisk/rd<br /># <b>ramdiskadm</b><br />Block Device&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp; <br />Removable<br />/dev/ramdisk/rd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 52428800&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes&nbsp;<br /># <b>kstat -n system_pages | grep pagesfree</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pagesfree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 83507<br /># <b>kstat -n system_pages | grep pageslocked</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pageslocked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38988<br /></pre><p>Let's subtract the original number of <i>pageslocked</i> from the latest 
value and multiply by the pagesize:
</p><pre># <b>pagesize</b><br />4096<br /># <b>bc</b><br /><b>(38988-26170)\*4096</b><br />52502528<br /><b>\^D</b><br /></pre><p>
The increase in locked pages can be attributed to the 
creation of the RAM disk (50m + a small amount of overhead).&nbsp; So yes, these pages are locked into memory.&nbsp; But it would be nice to get a definitive statement on what <i>pageslocked</i> actually means.&nbsp; According to McDougal, Mauro and Gregg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Solaris-Performance-Tools-Techniques-OpenSolaris/dp/0131568191/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1212008613&amp;sr=8-1"><i>Performance and Tools: DTrace and 
MDB Techniques for Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris</i></a>, p<i>ageslocked</i> is &quot;Total number of pages locked into memory by the kernel and user processes&quot;.&nbsp; Furthermore, the man page for <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5168/plock-3c?a=view">plock(3C)</a>, a related library routine which enables programmers to lock memory segments, states that &quot;Locked segments are immune to all routine swapping&quot;.&nbsp; What's routine swapping?</p><p>  Hmm.&nbsp; Anybody care to shed some light on this?<br /></p>

<p>Looking at the opensolaris source, the physical pages allocated by a ramdisk are locked.  They cannot be swapped out.  I would assume this is the same for Solaris 10 and prior.</p>

As an adjunct to the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/entry/enabling_remote_mdb_debugging_of">previous blog post</a>, a slightly customized boot environment capable of enabling serial console kernel debugging was required to diagnose Solaris install problems.&nbsp; The post itself mentioned that a nice way to accomplish this was to set up PXE network boot via <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/jumpstart_x86_x64.jsp">Solaris jumpstart</a>.&nbsp; It is indeed flexible and enables one to experiment with modifications and quickly test whether they perform as expected.&nbsp; The one downside to this environment is that an additional DHCP/TFTP boot server has to be configured.&nbsp; To eliminate that service, you could, once the customizations are well understood, simply create a new version of the Solaris install DVD with your customizations.&nbsp; Let's run through the process for a simple example.</p><p>1. Get a Solaris DVD.&nbsp; For this example, we'll use an interim build of the upcoming Solaris 10 Update 5.</p><p>2.

<p>Hi, <br/>
  Is this method valid for recreating opensolaris iso image after modification ? <br/>
I tried it but after booting from the modified iso image the system goes to maintenance mode.</p>


<p>mkisofs -R -b boot/grub/stage2_eltorito -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -R -L -r -D -U  -joliet-long -max-iso9660-filenames -boot-info-table -o <br/>
/export/iso/modified-osol-0811.iso /export/modified-opensolaris</p>


<p>is not working with -L option so I created the iso without -L option.</p>


<p>Is there any mistake I am doing here ?</p>

<p>Man, it's been over eight years since looking at this. The mkisofs(8) man page has a huge number of options.  I'd suggest looking at the details there.  One online manpage doc, <a href="http://www.unix.com/man-page/opensolaris/8/mkisofs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.unix.com/man-page/opensolaris/8/mkisofs/</a> does point to some authors.  This is old stuff, maybe you could try to contact them?</p>

<p>Our partners do a fair amount of business supplying ruggedized Solaris-powered <a href="http://www.panasonic.com/business/toughbook/products.asp">Panasonic Toughbook</a> computers to their US government/military customers.&nbsp; As a regular part of the product cycle, Sun usually works with both the integrators and Panasonic to assure that as new models become available, Solaris runs on these systems properly.&nbsp; Furthermore, when we can get our grubby little hands on the systems, we'll run them through our certification suite of tests and formally place them on the Solaris <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/hcl/">Hardware Compatibility List</a>.&nbsp; As an example, here's the certification report for one of the versions of the <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/hcl/data/systems/details/1432.html">Panasonic Toughbook CF-29</a>.</p><p>Panasonic recently introduced a new version of the <a href="http://catalog2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ModelDetail?displayTab=O&amp;storeId=11201&amp;catalogId=13051&amp;itemId=100537&amp;catGroupId=12871&amp;surfModel=Toughbook-30">Toughbook CF-30</a> (referred to as revision F) which tweaks some of the computer subsystems resulting in an all-too-familiar scenario: namely, these differences cause the current version of Solaris to fail to install.&nbsp; Note: Solaris is not alone here, all Operating Systems must continually play this cat and mouse game to support the latest hardware/firmware advances.</p><p>Our initial hypothesis lead us to believe that the problem was related to the introduction of the Intel ICH8 SATA chipset.&nbsp; So we called on some of our Solaris I/O experts, based out of Sun's Beijing office, to take a peek at what was going on.&nbsp; As the laptop is currently in New York, we needed a way for folks half way around the world to have access to this system.&nbsp; There are lots of mechanisms available to remotely diagnose systems, what's somewhat unique here is the following: (1) the diagnosis takes place very early in the boot stage, way before any windowing or networking is set up and (2) The system in question is a laptop, not a server, where things like Lights Out Management (LOM) service processors are non-existent.</p><p>The solution here was to utilize decades old RS-232 technology combined with some of features of the <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/grub_boot_solaris.jsp">GRUB bootloader</a>.&nbsp; Here are two requirements needed:<br /></p><ul><li>A serial connection must be established between the system to be diagnosed, which will be referred to henceforth as the <i>target</i>, and the system which accesses the target which we'll refer to as the <i>remote host</i>. &nbsp; Unfortunately most laptop manufacturers have seen fit to eliminate serial port connectors in lieu of using USB to serial converters as a replacement technology.&nbsp; At the early stages of boot, USB/serial capability is not yet available, so these systems are not good candidates for this type of diagnosis.&nbsp; Thankfully the target in question here, the Panasonic CF-30 Toughbook, still comes with a serial port.</li></ul><ul><li>A Jumpstart environment capable of installing Solaris on x86/x64 systems is strongly recommended.&nbsp; As part of the process described below, we'll be modifying the target's GRUB environment&nbsp; (<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">menu.lst</font>).&nbsp; If you chose to use a DVD boot/install environment instead, you'd need to modify and burn a new DVD for each change made to the target's boot environment.&nbsp; It took a bit of time to find the right incantations in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">menu.lst</font> file to get what was needed here; continually re-burning DVDs would have been excruciating.&nbsp; This exercise is left to the reader, <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/jumpstart_x86_x64.jsp">here's a good start</a> to understanding the jumpstart setup process.</li></ul><p>Here's how to set up the remote console environment:</p><p>1. A null modem cable must be physically connected between the <i>remote host </i>and <i>target</i>.&nbsp; The most common cable required will be a DB-9 female-to-female connector.&nbsp; Your configuration may vary.</p><p>2. Check the BIOS of the <i>remote host</i> and <i>target</i> and make sure serial ports are enabled.</p><p>3. Running Solaris on the <i>remote host</i>, we'll be using the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-0210/6m6nb7mn9?a=view"><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">tip(1)</font></a> command to access the <i>target</i> via serial port.&nbsp; Edit the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/etc/remote</font> file and look for the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">hardwire:</font> entry.&nbsp; Modify it to look like this:</p><pre>hardwire:\\<br />        :dv=/dev/term/a:br#9600:el=\^C\^S\^Q\^U\^D:ie=%$:oe=\^D:<br /><br /></pre><p>4. As part of setting up a jumpstart install for the <i>target</i>, a series of files are created in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/tftpboot</font> directory of the jumpstart server.&nbsp; Under <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/tftpboot</font>, there should be a custom <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">menu.lst</font> file for each managed install, suffixed by the unique network MAC address of the system in question.&nbsp; For example, the network MAC address for the CF-30 in question is 0:b:97:db:c0:97.&nbsp; The related /tftpboot file for the CF-30 turns out to be <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/tftpboot/menu.lst.01000B97DBC097.</font> As your target will have a different MAC address, it's <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">menu.lst</font>&nbsp; file will have a different suffix in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/tftpboot</font> directory.&nbsp; Edit that custom menu.lst file (for example, <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/tftpboot/menu.lst.01000B97DBC097)</font> to look as follows:</p><pre>default=0<br />timeout=30<br />serial --unit=0 --speed=9600<br />terminal serial<br />title Solaris_10 s10x_u5b10<br />        kernel /I86PC.Solaris_10-1/multiboot kernel/unix -B console=ttya,install_media=192.168.1.5:/export/s10x_u5b10 -vkd<br />        module /I86PC.Solaris_10-1/x86.miniroot<br /><br /></pre><p>The key modifications here involve (1) inclusion of the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">serial --unit=0 --speed=9600</font> and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">terminal serial</font> lines plus (2) additional arguments added to the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">kernel</font> directive.&nbsp; Grub is very fussy about the order and placement of arguments; playing around with these will likely change grub's behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>5.&nbsp; From the <i>remote host</i>, access the serial console of the <i>target</i> by issuing:</p><pre>$ tip hardwire</pre><p>6. Inside a terminal window, here's what the serial console looks like, after the system has been power cycled and runs through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test">POST</a> sequence:<br /></p><p><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="bottom" src="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/resource/remote-console/grub_console.jpg" /><br /></p><p>After the miniroot is loaded, you'll be presented with an mdb prompt and a screen which looks like this:</p><p><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="bottom" src="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/resource/remote-console/mdb_prompt.jpg" /></p><p>You can now issue mdb commands to diagnose.&nbsp; In this scenario you should also be able to reboot the&nbsp; system without any other manual intervention, like this:</p><p><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="bottom" src="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/resource/remote-console/mdb_reboot.jpg" />&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what issuing the mdb commands '<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">:c</font>' and '<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">$c</font>' look like in this environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this simple&nbsp; trace we can ascertain that the SATA drivers were never even loaded.&nbsp; Turns out this is likely a VM problem.&nbsp; Here's the filed <a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org/view_bug.do?bug_id=6687394">bug report</a>.</p><p><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="bottom" src="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/resource/remote-console/simple_mdb.jpg" /><br /></p>

<p>Unfortunately Hans, unless the system is equipped with a service processor, you'll need to have physical access to the system in order to reboot when it freezes.</p>


<p>In these remote debugging scenarios, I try to make it a point to be relatively available just in case manual intervention is required.</p>

<p>Unfortunately USB/serial support is lacking on a number of levels including  BIOS limitations, GRUB and probably Solaris early boot.  You're likely to be out of luck for some time to come.</p>


<p>From a GRUB perspective, the 'Summer of Code 2008' program is looking to introduce USB support into GRUB.  Check out <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-soc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-soc.html</a>   </p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>this helped me a lot.<br/>
But now, my server still wants to use the serial console - even though the serial cable is no longer connected and  the grub entry doesn't contain the &quot;serial&quot; entries any more.</p>


<p>Do you have an idea why this would happen?<br/>
It's a HP DL380G4 (I know, I know...) and Solaris 10 Update 5</p>

<p>Rainer,</p>


<p>For the sake of this discussion, the Solaris boot process takes place in two phases.  You have modified the menu.lst file which associates the console with the GRUB phase.  My guess is that the console at the Solaris level is not configured the way you want.   Take a look at the bootenv.rc file and specifically the 'setprop console ...' line to see what it says.</p>


<p>Ultimately, once this file is modified it needs to be placed in the boot_archive which is referenced by GRUB at boot time.  By default, at shutdown time, the boot_archive service runs to update the boot_archive if any of its component files are changed.</p>


<p>Hope this helps.  There are lots of other resources on the net which explain this far better and in far more detail.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I also posted on comp.unix.solaris and someone told me about the &quot;eeprom&quot; command that sets that property.<br/>
It's solved now and hopefully, google will pick it all up ;-)</p>


<p>Thanks for your reply, though, and as I said, your blog-post helped a lot to get me started.<br/>
With my old SPARC-boxes, I'd just plug in the cable and - poof - it just worked....</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I'm a novice on Solaris to start.</p>


<p>I would like to connect Ubuntu 9.10(linux) using putty with serial(null) to Sun Ultra 2 Solaris 10 serial cable connection.</p>


<p>The serial cable is on port b on the Ultra2.</p>


<p>Putty setting 9600,8,1</p>


<p>What is the parity &amp; flow control on putty need to be set to?</p>


<p>Thanks so much,<br/>

A <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/entry/reducing_your_java_se_runtime">previous blog post</a> demonstrated how you can, with minimal effort, lessen the disk footprint of a typical Java SE 5.0 runtime environment by about a third without violating the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/jdk-1_5_0_14-license.txt">Java Standard Edition Licensing agreement</a>. That post focused primarily on removing optional files and compressing class library jar files.&nbsp;  It turns out that with a little more engineering,&nbsp; there is significant opportunity for further space optimization.</p><p>These additional savings involve more intimate knowledge of the inner workings of Java SE.&nbsp; Sun performs this engineering work and provides a series of <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/embedded/#functionality">reduced footprint versions of Java SE</a>, in binary form, for some of the most common embedded platforms.&nbsp; They include some of these enhancements:<sup>1</sup></p><ul><li><b>Headless configuration</b> - The inclusion of graphics subsystems like AWT and Swing comprise a large chunk of the Java SE footprint.&nbsp; If your device has no graphics capability (i.e. is headless) why would you need to include this functionality?&nbsp; Headless configurations:</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Do not support keyboard or mouse input</li><li>Cannot create windows or display graphics</li><li>Throw a <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">HeadlessException</font> when a graphics API is called</li><li>Still support a functional Java 2D API for printing and off-screen rendering</li><li>Are still 100% Java SE compatible<br /></li></ol></blockquote><ul><li><b>Eliminate client or server compiler</b> - Sun's Java SE implementations include two HotSpot compilers, tuned and designed for specific environments.&nbsp; The client compiler focuses on things like fast user interactivity and quick startup, while the server compiler's priority is on optimizing large, long-lived server applications.&nbsp; The Java SE VM can only use one of these compilers at a time, so removing the unused one can save considerable space.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Minimizes memory consumption</b> - Standard Java SE allocates RAM to house things like the JIT code cache and the object heap.&nbsp; By default, each one of these areas (and others) can be assigned 64 MB.&nbsp; In an embedded platform where the total amount of RAM might only be 64MB, Java SE will simply not have enough memory to run.&nbsp; Java SE Embedded on the other hand, will automatically adapt memory usage to the amount of available RAM.&nbsp; Consequently, 64MB is a reasonable amount of RAM for a large set of embedded Java applications.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Space vs. speed tradeoffs</b> - (1) Java SE implements a thread lookup table, which in layman's terms, helps save a few instructions when switching between Java threads.&nbsp; By eliminating this table, a couple of MBs of RAM can be spared from your application's working set. (2) Java SE also sets aside an area (mmap'ed) for loading jar files into random access memory, which as was explained to me, may help performance, but may also result in duplicate copies of jar files in memory.&nbsp; Removal of this area further reduces the Resident Set Size.</li></ul><p><b>An Example</b></p><p>Following through with the exmaple in the last post., let's start with an unmodified version of <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/5.0_13/index.html">Java SE 5.0 Update 13 for Linux/x86</a>.&nbsp; By default, the static footprint is approximately 88MB.<br /></p><pre><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk ./jre1.5.0_13/</b><br />   88185&nbsp;&nbsp; ./jre1.5.0_13/</font><br /></pre>After following the directions in the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/entry/reducing_your_java_se_runtime">previous post</a>, we can pare it down to roughly 60MB.<br /><pre>   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/</b><br />   59358   /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/ <br /></pre><p>Downloading <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/embedded.jsp">Sun's reduced footprint version of Java SE for x86/Linux</a> yields:<!--<--><br /></p><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk /tmp/jre1.5.0_10/</b><br /><b></b>   31003   /tmp/jre1.5.0_10/<br /></pre><pre></pre><p>This version of the JRE is about one-third it's original size, and furthermore has been modified to use significantly less memory than the standard Java SE offerings.&nbsp; Note: we are comparing slightly different updates of Java SE 1.5 (update 13 vs. update 10).&nbsp; They are indeed not identical but their differences should be considered, for the sake of argument, negligible.&nbsp;</p><p><font size="1">[1] Many thanks to Bob Vandette, who though presentation and conversation, supplied this information.&nbsp; One of many sources comes from Bob's Java ONE 2007 session called, <a title="http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2007/pdf/TS-2602.pdf"><i>Deploying Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE Platform) in Today's Embedded Devices</i> (TS-2602)</a></font> <br /></p><p><br /></p>

<p>Great job.</p>


<p>I certainly hope we(Java people) will have a easier way of picking what we need the JRE for.<br/>
One giant step towards lighter Java.</p>


<p>I do remember a speech in which i found out that a project of Java Kernel is on the way to shrink Java (jvm i suppose) to run just what you need.</p>

BODY: 
<p>Because the resource requirements for <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/index.jsp">Java Standard Edition</a> are by no means insignificant, developers interested in utilizing Java on smaller platforms have traditionally opted for one of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/index.jsp">Java Micro Edition</a> configurations.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should therefore come as no surprise that some of the Standard Edition functionality has to be sacrificed in these constrained Java ME environments.&nbsp; However, as the trend towards more capable devices continues, it becomes reasonable to once again consider the advantages of utilizing Java SE.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with a static footprint that could easily exceed 100MB, Java SE may still be too large to swallow for a lot of applications.<br /><br />It is duly noted that the criticism leveled at Sun for exacting too much control
over the Java platform has been widespread.&nbsp; Like it or not though, one benefit of Sun's initial stewardship has been that Java SE
has remained a standard platform, and threats to splinter it have thus
far been reasonably thwarted.&nbsp; Accordingly, in order to avoid incompatibilities, there are restrictions spelled out in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/jdk-1_5_0_14-license.txt">Java SE Licensing Agreement</a> which prohibit modification of the Java SE binary distribution.</p><p>That&nbsp; being said, there are a list of optional files, specified by the Java Runtime Environment's <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/resource/java_se/JRE_SAMPLE_README.txt"><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">README</font></a> file which can be removed, without ramification, to lessen the footprint.&nbsp; They include:<br /></p><ul><li>Deployment tools (e.g. Java Web Start, Java plugin)</li><li>IDL and RMI tools (e.g. rmid, tnameserv)<br /> </li><li>Security tools (e.g. policytool, keytool)</li><li>orbd</li><li>Localization (charsets.jar)</li></ul><p>In addition, further space optimization can be achieved by compressing the class library files contained in the <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">rt.jar</font> file.&nbsp; By default, Java SE ships this jar file uncompressed.&nbsp; The tradeoff here is space vs. performance, i.e. the classloader must expend cycles to uncompress the Java classes as they are being loaded.</p><p><b>An Example</b></p><p>So let's download a sample JRE from <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a> and see how it's footprint can be minimized.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this example, we'll use <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/5.0_13/index.html">Java SE 1.5.0 Update 13 for Linux x86</a>.</p><p>After installation, the JRE is approximately 88MB</p><pre><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk ./jre1.5.0_13/</b><br />   88185&nbsp;&nbsp; ./jre1.5.0_13/</font><br /></pre><p>Here's what it looks like after removal of the optional files<br /></p><pre>   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>cd jre1.5.0_13/</b><br /><b></b><br />   jimc@jalopy:/tmp/jre1.5.0_13&gt; <b>/bin/rm -rf lib/charsets.jar lib/ext/sunjce_provider.jar \\</b><br /><b>   lib/ext/localedata.jar lib/ext/ldapsec.jar </b><b>lib/ext/dnsns.jar bin/rmid \\</b><br /><b>   bin/rmiregistry bin/tnameserv bin/keytool bin/kinit bin/klist bin/ktab \\</b><br /><b>   bin/policytool bin/orbd bin/servertool bin/javaws, lib/javaws/ and lib/javaws.jar</b><br /><b></b><br />   jimc@jalopy:/tmp/jre1.5.0_13&gt; <b>cd ..</b><b></b><br />   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk ./jre1.5.0_13/</b><br />   77227   ./jre1.5.0_13/<br /></pre><p>And after rt.jar has been compressed</p><pre>   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>mkdir rtjar</b><br />   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>cd rtjar/</b><br /><b></b><br />   jimc@jalopy:/tmp/rtjar&gt; <b>jar -xf /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/lib/rt.jar</b><br /><b></b>   jimc@jalopy:/tmp/rtjar&gt; <b>zip -q -r /tmp/rt .</b><br />   jimc@jalopy:/tmp/rtjar&gt; <b>mv /tmp/rt.zip /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/lib/rt.jar</b><br /><b></b><br />   jimc@jalopy:/tmp/rtjar&gt; <b>du -sk /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/</b><br />   59358   /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/  </pre><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>In many cases, you can lop off about a third of the Java Runtime Environment footprint with no ill effects.&nbsp; In a future post, we'll discuss how Sun has further reduced Java SE significantly, not only from the point of view of static footprint, but also from a RAM usage perspective too.&nbsp; For a preview you can check out Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/embedded/">Java SE Embedded</a> technology.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Compressing rt.jar like this doesn't make much sense. Deflate isn't all that great after all. Most installers utilize LZMA is is far superior to Deflate.</p>


<p>The best strategy is using Pack200 (without GZip compression) and an installer which uses LZMA on top. The installer also has to take care of unpack200-ing the jars after the initial decompression. This is fairly easy with NSIS for example.</p>


<p>Of course this strategy is meant to reduce the size of the download. The used disk space after installation won't be affected. Well, it would be possible to recompress the jars (after un-lzma-ing and unpack200-ing). The price is a slightly longer install and slightly longer loading times. It's not that bad though - Java's deflate routines are highly optimized.</p>


<p>Well, 6uN (that Kernel thing) will solve most of this issue.</p>

<p>Your points are quite valid with regards to installation.  The theme of this post was to demonstrate how to optimize the disk footprint of an \*already installed\* JRE without significant re-engineering.    Although a generic solution, I think these suggestions apply more to the embedded systems folks than they do to general purpose desktop/server solutions.  In many instances in the embedded world, installation is done with entire images, rather than using traditional package installation.</p>


<p>Using zip to compress jar files is simple and universal, does shrink the the jar files by about a half, and is understood by the jar classloader.  It would be cool to use even better compression, but that would require a  modified classloader.  If there are alternatives that the stock classloaders understand, I'd sincerely like to hear about them.    If we could further reduce the on-disk footprint, that would be great.</p>

<p>Zip/Deflate compression can be improved by a few percent with tools like DeflOpt (formerly BJWFlate), KZip, and ZipMix. The first two just try very hard to compress the files as good as possible and ZipMix takes two zips and puts the best compressed individual files into a new zip file.</p>

<a href="http://www.walbeehm.com/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.walbeehm.com/download/</a></p>


<p>Obfuscators can also help quite a bit. Using multiple obfuscators can even help more. However, generally it's a &quot;bit&quot; on the crazy side. It's something we all did over at JGO (<a href="http://javagaming.org" rel="nofollow">http://javagaming.org</a> ) for the 4k competitions. It's only worth it if every byte counts. (But even then it's crazy.)</p>


<p>Well, the only kind of archives you can directly load are stored jars and deflated jars. Pack200 can be quickly added with a custom classloader. However, the format isn't suited for loading specific classes and the format itself isn't really well compressed (it's highly compressable though). While Pack200 helps compression immensely, it's only good for reducing the size of a download (applet, webstart, installer etc).</p>


<p>Here is some diagram of the effect of Deflate, LZMA, GZip, and Pack200 (on a pure code jar):<br/>
<a href="http://kaioa.com/svg/compression_ratio.svgz" rel="nofollow">http://kaioa.com/svg/compression_ratio.svgz</a> (looks better with Opera)</p>


<p>Some mix of LZMA and Pack200 with directly accessible files would be great, but I don't really think that's something we'll see any time soon. It's just too specific and it would be sort of slow.</p>

<p>Compressing rt.jar will have some adverse effect on startup.  It appears to be proportional to the clock speed of the embedded CPU.  For clocks in excess of 1Ghz, this may be negligible.  For slower clock cycles the effect can be modest.  You mileage will vary, but we have some unofficial anecdotal evidence of 10% or more degradation in some cases.  Of course you could always uncompress rt.jar and forego this space optimization altogether.</p>

<p>I may have a slot for a performance test un few months. I was wondering the inpact of compression knowing that disk IO are slower than memory IO. Compressing should minimize disk IO (using more CPU) and finally be quicker ...<br/>
Also I noticed on my own jar a strong impact on jar indexation that is often forgoten. I was thinking about a small loop that would rejar all JDK .jar files to ensure indexation and maybe (depending on perf result) compression or decompression (disk space doesn't really matter).<br/>
What do think about that ?</p>

<p>As I know, IBM JDK does default compress their rt.jar.</p>


<p>Sun JRE installation package is using pack200 technology since JRE5.</p>


<p>I think, it as a major reason of why Sun do not compress their jar. Sun wants to provide a better &quot;cold start&quot; speed.  The IBM JRE usually used with JEE container and &quot;cold start&quot; is not that important.</p>


<p>I had tried it few year ago, compress rt.jar in JRE1.4.2 in a old machine.<br/>
When I use the compressed JAR, it can bring quite a noticeable amount of delay during startup.</p>

<p>Currently, the cyclic driver that comes with Java RTS is specific to a particular Solaris 10 update release.  During installation, if your version of the OS doesn't match what Java RTS requires, it won't install.</p>


<p>You'd need the source code for the cyclic driver and recompile on your platform.  Unfortunately this isn't public.  In the future we hope to better decouple the cyclic driver dependency from Solaris, but for now, if you're interested in using Java RTS on Solaris, you'll have to choose one of the supported platforms.</p>


<p>FYI, for a little more info on the cyclic driver, check out this blog:<br/>

The brief but brilliant era of computing has seen companies come and go, many relegated to the ash heap of history because they failed to heed this simple rule:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <i>In the long run general purpose solutions will always win out over specialized proprietary ones.&nbsp;</i>
<br />&nbsp;<br />As a long time employee of Sun Microsystems, I've witnessed firsthand the effects, both positive and negative, that this law has had on my company.&nbsp; Sun can attribute it's initial meteoric rise to the fact that it offered a viable alternative to the popular minicomputer platform of the day.&nbsp; The first Sun workstations were built from commercial off-the-shelf components, and although nearly equal in performance to the minicomputer, they were so much more affordable that they became good enough.&nbsp; And of course over time, as Moore's law might dictate, those initial deficiencies quickly dissipated, and in fact surpassed traditional minicomputer capabilities.<br />&nbsp;<br />Somewhere along the line Sun lost sight of this ideal and began incorporating more proprietary technology into their products.&nbsp; At first the strategy appeared to be successful as Sun was well positioned to reap huge benefits during the Internet bubble.&nbsp; Meanwhile, low-cost general purpose servers were continuously improving.&nbsp; When the bubble burst they in turn became good enough alternatives to the powerful but costly Sun servers.&nbsp; The resulting decline of Sun was rapid, and it's taken the better part of a decade for us to recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; This story has been told -- and will continue to be again and again -- for those refusing to learn this lesson.&nbsp; A professor of mine once told me, &quot;If there's anything we've learned from history, it's that we haven't learned anything from history&quot;.</p><p>When markets mature, even those where technology is paramount, economic considerations dominate. General purpose systems scale on every dimension (unit, management, training and integration costs) whereas proprietary systems do not.&nbsp; A switch to more standard components should in no way be construed as stifling innovation.&nbsp; Rather, general purpose systems help create new innovation by building from common elements economically appealing in their own right, and presumably even more economically beneficial once combined.<sup>1</sup></p><blockquote><font size="1">[1] The above paragraph was taken in bits and pieces from an email exchange with Dave Hofert, Java Embedded and Real-Time Marketing Manager.&nbsp; His points were so compelling I couldn't help myself.</font><br /></blockquote><p>Real-time industrial controllers could be the next market ripe for disruption.&nbsp; Admittedly this is an entrenched and conservative lot.&nbsp; But the economics of general purpose computing cannot be denied.&nbsp; As organizations strive to further eliminate cost out of their system, revisiting usage and deployment of industrial controllers, typically via custom proprietary <a title="PLCs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller">PLCs</a>, is falling under review.&nbsp;

<p>Since the authoring of this blog entry, the aforementioned system has gone through some modifications based upon customer input.  iGoLogic (<a href="http://igologic.com)" rel="nofollow">http://igologic.com)</a> provides the enclosure and the overall system.  It is referred to as NA-043.  We've gotten a hold of the iGoLogic folks and it is their plan to have further information about this system on their website within a week or so.</p>

BODY: 
<p>Any modern x86/x64 processor worth its salt comes equipped with an <a title="Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APIC">Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller</a>, or APIC.&nbsp; Among the features that an APIC provides is access to high resolution timers.&nbsp; Without such capability, the default interrupt source for timer and cyclic operations has a precision on the order of 10 milliseconds -- hardly fine-grained enough for any serious real-time work.</p><p>The <a title="cyclic subsystem" href="http://blogs.sun.com/eschrock/date/20041127">cyclic subsystem</a>, introduced in Solaris 8, gives Solaris the capability to support high resolution timers.&nbsp; The <a title="Sun Java Real-Time System" href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/index.jsp">Sun Java Real-Time System</a> version 2.0, available for Solaris on both x86 and Sparc platforms, includes an additional package called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SUNWrtjc</font>:&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Java Real-Time System cyclic driver</font>.&nbsp; This package exposes an interface to the cyclic subsystem, normally only available to the kernel.&nbsp; For those already familiar with Sun's Java RTS, you've no doubt noticed that you either need to run as superuser or assign a set of fine-grained privileges to an ordinary user account. (<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">sys_res_config, proc_priocntl, proc_lock_memory</font><i> </i>and<i> </i><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">proc_clock_highres</font><i>).&nbsp; </i>The<i> </i><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">proc_clock_highres</font> privilege gives access to those timers.<i><br /></i></p><p>Originally developed on an AMD Athlon-based PC, I recently moved a Real-Time Java project over to my Toshiba Tecra A1 laptop running the same version of Solaris and Java RTS.&nbsp; With the goal of getting in a little development time during a long flight, that migration suddenly casued timings to be all wrong.&nbsp; Why, might you ask, would moving an application from one seemingly identical Solaris environment to another cause this unusual behavior?&nbsp; Turns out that even though the laptop, a Pentium 4M based system, has an APIC, it was never exposed by the laptop BIOS.&nbsp; In this scenario, regardless what you do from a Solaris perspective, you'll never get access to the high-res timers.&nbsp; </p><p>This phenomenon appears to be most prevelant in laptops.&nbsp; As they account for about 50% (or more?) of PCs sold today, developers have a realistic chance of running into this situation.&nbsp; You can issue this magic Solaris incantation to determine if your system has high-res timer support:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace"># echo &quot;psm_timer_reprogram::print&quot;&nbsp; | mdb -k</font><br />
<br />If anything but '<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">apic_timer_reprogram</font>' is then displayed, your machine
has no exposed APIC, and is probably unsuitable for Java RTS.&nbsp; In some cases the BIOS may be configurable with regards to APIC support; in many others it is simply not available.<br /></p><p>In the absence of an APIC, there is the potential to improve the high-resolution timing by setting the following tunable in <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">/etc/system</font>:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">set hires_tick=1
</font><br />
<br />Following a reboot, this would change the clock tick frequency from 100 to 1000 ticks per second. This frequency can then be further tuned by setting the hires_hz tunable to the desired value:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">set hires_hz=10000</font>
<br />
<br />The default value is 1000 ticks per second; higher values are not
officially supported.
<br />
<br />Note that tuning your machine in this way does not come without cost.&nbsp; It is likely to degrade overall
performance, as the system will need to spend a larger proportion of time handling the larger frequency of clock interrupts.<sup>1</sup></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="1">[1] Thank you&nbsp; Christophe Lizzi for your explanation of the problem and potential workaround.</font><br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the advent of Java RTS 2.0 Update 1, support for Solaris 10 (8/07) is included.  So there's no need to search for older versions of Solaris.</p>

<p>I don't understand how setting hires_tick=1 changes the clock tick frequency from 100 to 1000 ticks per second. I assume hires_tick is a simple boolean value, and I have the choice of either 100 (a tick every 10ms) or 1000 (a tick every 1ms). But then what about the hires_hz setting? It appears to be redundant, since hires_tick=1 seems to have a meaning identical to hires_hz=1000. Does hires_hz simply override the hires_tick setting? </p>

<p>Trevor,</p>


<p>I just did a little experimenting here.  In order to specify a higher clock frequency, you must first set hires_tick=1 regardless what you do with hires_hz.  Placing an entry in /etc/system which looks like this:</p>


<p>   set hires_tick=1</p>


<p>is identical to:</p>


<p>   set hires_tick=1<br/>
   set hires_hz=1000</p>


<p>To set an even higher clock tick frequency (at your own peril), say 10000, edit /etc/system to look like this:</p>


<p>   set hires_tick=1<br/>
   set hires_hz=10000</p>

<p>Re: Can Java RTS be installed on OpenSolaris?</p>


<p>1) First off, is it not supported.</p>


<p>2) The cyclic driver mentioned above is compiled specifically for a Solaris release.  In order for it to work on the version of OpenSolaris you're using, it's source would have to be re-compiled on a system running the same version.  We hope to decouple this dependency in the future.</p>


<p>3) Unfortunately the cyclic driver source code is not publicly available.</p>


<p>3) Without the cyclic driver, as mentioned above, you won't get high resolution timers.  You can increase the clock rate in Solaris as the blog entry suggests to get a finer resolution, and try running JavaRTS.  For the overhead ramifications take a look at this follow-on entry:</p>

<p>Jim Clarke, Eric Bruno and I have been selected to present this year at <a title="Java ONE" href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">Java ONE</a>.&nbsp; The title of our session is called &quot;TS-1205 The Sun Java Real-Time System Meets Wall Street&quot;.&nbsp; We're scheduled to present on Wednsday, May 9 at 10:55AM - 11:55AM Pacific in the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco.&nbsp; If you plan on attending, please stop by and see us.&nbsp; For those that can't make the event, we'll be sure to post the slides once we're permitted.<br /></p><p>To get an idea of what we'll discuss, take a look at the abstract below;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;ABSTRACT</p><p><i>Today's financial institutions use program trading systems to automatically execute split-second trades based on sophisticated algorithms that assess current market conditions. Trade decisions and execution must occur in a timely fashion to capitalize on the market. Missing a trade opportunity, even by a few seconds, can lead to significant losses.<br /><br />With improvements in Java technology performance, firms are starting to use Java technology to implement these algorithms and thereby realizing productivity gains over more-traditional C/C++ development. However, in these time-critical systems, there is still no guarantee that at any instant, the process will not be interrupted by the Java platform garbage collector. Although trade execution occurs most of the time within an acceptable response time, the trade execution is delayed every once in a while, due to garbage collection or some other system event.<br /><br />Sun's implementation of the Real-Time Specification for Java (JSR 001), the Sun Java Real-Time System, enables real-time processing through techniques that protect important threads from garbage collection and other system interrupts. This means that trading systems can confidently monitor the market and take action consistently within a calculated window of opportunity.<br /><br />To demonstrate the impact of these techniques, Sun's OEM Software Systems Engineering technical team has written a demonstration of a trading system that uses real trade data. The demonstration compares a regular Java virtual machine against the Sun Java Real-Time System. For each run, a graph shows the difference in the actual trade price and the price when the trade should have executed. Running this trading system with the Sun Java Real-Time System shows that no money is lost due to garbage collection latencies. The results will be contrasted with the same application run with the standard (non-real-time) Java virtual machine.<br /><br />This presentation demonstrates a working system and proves real-time Java technology's ability to satisfy hard real-time trading requirements.</i><br /></p>

John,  I'm not sure my first response made it ...  We only have one slot to present.  I can't speak for Joshua, but would bet he's got the same situation.

Curious, do you belong to a financial services organization?  No promises, but perhaps we could arrange to present to your company, at a minimum remotely.

TITLE: Crosstool Environment in a Solaris Zone
DATE: 03/10/2017 23:25:02
PRIMARY CATEGORY: Sun
STATUS: draft
ALLOW COMMENTS: 1

BODY: 
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span><br />
The task of building Java ME CDC-HI binaries and their associated cross
development environments tends to be very linux-centric.&nbsp; Utilities like <a href="http://www.kegel/crosstool">Crosstool</a>,
which make
this process much more tolerable, also make various linux and GNU
assumptions that differ from
standard Solaris.&nbsp; By introducing new paths and GNU versions of
applications, it is possible to mimic this environment in
Solaris.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, by creating a new zone with this environment, we
can isolate these changes without affecting other Solaris system
settings.<br />
<br />
1. Create a Solaris zone called 'toolzone'</p><p><i>Note: This step is system specific.&nbsp; For example, the hostname and IP address for 'toolzone' was predefined.&nbsp; In addition, the network interface (i.e. 'set physical=iprb0') is likely to be different also.</i><br />
<br />
Here's the command-line session for creating the zone:<br />
</p><pre>phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">mkdir /zone</span><br />phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zonecfg -z toolzone</span><br />toolzone: No such zone configured<br />Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.<br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">create</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set zonepath=/zone/toolzone</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set autoboot=true</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">add net</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone:net&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set address=toolzone</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone:net&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set physical=iprb0</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone:net&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">info</span><br />zonepath: /zone/toolzone<br />autoboot: true<br />pool:<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /lib<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /platform<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /sbin<br />inherit-pkg-dir:<br />        dir: /usr<br />net:<br />        address: toolzone<br />        physical: iprb0<br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">verify</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">commit</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">\^D<br /><br /></span>phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zoneadm list -vc</span><br />  ID NAME             STATUS         PATH<br />   0 global           running        /<br />   - toolzone      configured        /zone/toolzone<br /><br />phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zoneadm -z toolzone</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> install</span><br />Preparing to install zone &lt;toolzone&gt;.<br />Creating list of files to copy from the global zone.<br />Copying &lt;6666&gt; files to the zone.<br />Initializing zone product registry.<br />Determining zone package initialization order.<br />Preparing to initialize &lt;945&gt; packages on the zone.<br />Initialized &lt;945&gt; packages on zone.<br />Zone &lt;toolzone&gt; is initialized.<br />Installation of &lt;2&gt; packages was skipped.<br />Installation of these packages generated warnings: &lt;SUNWcsu SUNWsogm&gt;<br />The file &lt;/zone/toolzone/root/var/sadm/system/logs/install_log&gt; contains a log of the zone installation.<br /></pre>2.&nbsp; Configure the zone.<br />
<br />
2a. Create a zone-specific /usr/bin directory and copy the contents of
the
global zone's /usr/bin to this new directory.<br />
<pre style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://#</span> mkdir -p /zone/toolzone/usr/bin<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://#</span> cd /usr/bin<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://#</span> tar cf - . | (cd /zone/toolzone/usr/bin; tar xfp -)<br /></pre>
2b. Create a loopback mount for toolzone to this new version of
/usr/bin:<br />
<pre><span style="font-weight: normal;">phoenix://</span># <span style="font-weight: bold;">zonecfg -z toolzone</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">addfs</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set dir=/usr/bin</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set special=/zone/toolzone</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">/usr/bin</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">set type=lofs</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone:fs&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br />zonecfg:toolzone&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">\^D</span><br /></pre>
2c. Boot and configure the newly created zone:<br />
<pre>phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zoneadm -z toolzone</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> boot</span><br />phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zlogin -C toolzone</span><br /></pre>
2d. Change the path of the default shell to /usr/bin/bash.&nbsp; This
is required for crosstool to operate correctly.<br />
<pre>toolzone://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd /usr/bin</span><br />toolzone:bin/# <span style="font-weight: bold;">mv sh sh.ORIG</span><br />toolzone:bin/# <span style="font-weight: bold;">ln -s /usr/bin/bash sh</span><br /></pre>
2e. Create a new user in toolzone.&nbsp; For this example, we'll
use 'cdc'.&nbsp; This exercise is left to the user.<br />
<pre>toolzone://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">grep cdc /etc/passwd</span><br />cdc:x:600:10:CDC-HI build user:/export/home/cdc:/usr/bin/bash<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></pre>
2f. Create a directoy called /opt/gnulinks and make sure the 'cdc' user
owns it.&nbsp; This directory will house versions and links&nbsp; to
GNU utilities which differ from their Solaris counterparts.<br />
<pre>toolzone://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">mkdir /opt/gnulinks</span><br />toolzone://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">chown cdc:staff /opt/gnulinks</span><br />toolzone://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">ls -ld /opt/gnulinks</span><br />drwxr-xr-x   2 cdc      staff        512 Jun 19 13:14 /opt/gnulinks<br /></pre>
<br />
3. As the newly created 'cdc' user, configure the zone to build both
the crosstool environment and CDC-HI<br />
<br />
3a. Login to the zone as the 'cdc' user.<br />
<pre>phoenix://# <span style="font-weight: bold;">zlogin -l cdc toolzone</span><br />[Connected to zone 'toolzone' pts/6]<br />Last login: Mon Jun 19 12:57:05 on pts/6<br />Sun Microsystems Inc.   SunOS 5.10      Generic January 2005<br />toolzone:~/$<br /></pre>
3b. To get a zone-specific prompt, you might want to have an entry
in ~cdc/.bash_profile like:<br />
<pre>export PS1='\\h:\\W/\\$ '<br /></pre>
3c.&nbsp; Create links in /opt/gnulinks/bin which point to GNU versions
of unix utilities.&nbsp; This can be accomplised by executing the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jtc/resource/crosstool/gnulinks.sh" title="gnulinks.sh">gnulinks.sh</a> script which looks like:<br />
<pre><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>#!/bin/sh<br />GNULINKS_DIR=/opt/gnulinks/bin<br />GNU_PROGS=&quot;ar as egrep grep m4 make nm objcopy objdump strings strip tar thumb&quot;<br /><br />mkdir -p ${GNULINKS_DIR}<br />cd ${GNULINKS_DIR}<br />for PROG in ${GNU_PROGS}<br />do<br />    ln -s /usr/sfw/bin/g${PROG} ${PROG}<br />done<br /><br />toolzone:~/$ <b>sh gnulinks.sh</b><br /></pre>
3d. Modify PATH of 'cdc' user by putting the following line in

BODY: 
<p>In the financial services market, there is a general trend to move key systems close to, or even right inside the exchanges themselves -- the idea being that the nearer you are to the source, the less network infrastructure and latency you'll experience.&nbsp; With this advantage firms can potentially take on additional transaction loads at higher transaction rates.&nbsp; These systems typically use the latest Intel or AMD processors and run a commercial distribution of Linux.<sup>1</sup></p><blockquote><font size="1">[1] Thank you <a title="Eric Bruno" href="http://blogs.sun.com/ericbruno">Eric Bruno</a> for your brief description, and for unknowingly letting me (slightly) plagiarize your comments.</font><br /></blockquote><p>Indeed these co-located systems perform as expected <i>almost</i> all the time.&nbsp; But there are periodic intervals where the latency increases by several orders of magnitude, the ramifications of which could be financially disastrous.&nbsp; After eliminating other components, the street seems to be focusing its wrath on commercial Linux distributions and their lack of real-time capabilities.<br /><br />The linux community is actively working to include underpinnings to support real-time, but as of yet these capabilities are not part of a standard major (i.e. Red Hat, SuSE) distribution.&nbsp; Instead, an alternate version of linux with real-time extensions is offered.&nbsp; These extensions are in effect separate non-standard OS releases, and have not had the soak time required by many institutions.</p><p>Back in the early 90's, I volunteered to move over to Sun's newly formed SunSoft business unit.&nbsp; One of it's main charters was to push the concept of running Solaris on alternate, i.e. Intel, platforms.&nbsp; (<i>Don't get me started here, can you imagine where Solaris would be right now if Sun had actually taken this initiative seriously back then?</i>)&nbsp; As part of that transition, I had the opportunity to take a Solaris Internals course, and couldn't help but notice the effort put in architecturally to address short latencies.&nbsp; I still have the course notebook; it is dated September 1993.</p><p>The point is Solaris already has the real-time capabilities claimed by these add-on linux extensions.&nbsp; It is built into the operating system, has been for quite some time, is rock solid and doesn't require any additional components.&nbsp; A partial list of features include:</p><ul><li><b>Real-time Scheduling Class</b> - In order to allow equal opportunity to system resources, traditional Unix schedulers transparently change process priorities to give competing processes a fair chance.&nbsp; Although well suited for timesharing systems, this is unacceptable real-time behavior.&nbsp; Since its outset, Solaris through its SVR4 roots, introduced the concept of alternate scheduling classes.&nbsp; It includes a real-time scheduling class, which furnishes fixed-priority process scheduling at the highest priority levels in the system.<br /></li></ul><ul><li><b>Fine-Grained Processor Control / Processor Sets</b> - Solaris allows threads and applications to be bound to specific individual processors. In addition, processors within a system can be grouped together as a processor set and dedicated to real-time tasks.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Here's a nice <a title="article describing processor sets" href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/solaris_processor.html">article describing processor sets</a>. Dated June 2001,&nbsp; processor sets have been a part of Solaris since release 2.6.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Interrupt Sheltering</b> - Available since Solaris 7, this feature enables CPUs to be sheltered from unbound interrupts.&nbsp; It can be used in conjunction with processor sets to shelter all CPUs in a processor set.&nbsp; Note: At least one processor in the system must be kept unsheltered. <br /></li></ul><ul><li><b>Priority Inheritance</b> - Priority inversion occurs when a high-priority thread blocks on a resource that is held by a lower-priority thread. A runnable thread with a priority between the high and low-priority threads creates a priority inversion because it can receive processor resources ahead of the high-priority thread.&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote>To avoid priority inversions with kernel synchronization primitives, Solaris employs a transient priority inheritance protocol. The protocol enables the low-priority thread holding the resource to “inherit” the higher priority of the blocked high-priority thread. This approach gives the blocking low-priority thread the CPU resources it needs to complete its task as soon as possible so that it can release the synchronization primitive. Upon completion, all threads are returned to their respective priorities by the kernel.<sup>3</sup><br /></blockquote><ul><li><b>High Resolution Timers</b> - 
Solaris 8 introduces the cyclic subsystem; this allows for timers
of much better granularity -- in the microsecond and nanosecond range -- without burdening the system with a high
interrupt rate.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Memory Locking</b> - The paging in and out of data from disk to memory may be considered normal behavior for virtual memory systems, but it is unacceptable for real-time applications.&nbsp; Solaris addresses this problem by allowing the
locking down of a process' pages into memory, using <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5168/6mbb3hrhq?a=view" title="mlock(3C)">mlock(3C)</a> or <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5168/6mbb3hrhr?a=view" title="mlockall(3C)">mlockall(3C)</a> system calls.<br /></li></ul><ul><li><b>Early Binding</b> - By default, linking of dynamic libraries in the Solaris
is done on an as-needed basis. The runtime binding for a dynamically linked
function isn't determined until its first invocation. Though flexible,
this behavior can induce indeterminism and unpredictable jitter in the
timing of a real-time application. To avoid jitter, the Solaris provides for early binding of dynamic libraries. By setting
the LD_BIND_NOW environment variable to &quot;1&quot;, libraries are bound at application
startup time. Using early binding together with memory locking is a very
effective approach to avoiding jitter.<sup>4</sup></li></ul><blockquote><p><font size="1">[2,3,4] Shameful plagiarism from</font><font size="1"> <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/whitepapers/wp-realtime/wp-realtime.pdf" title="Scalable Real-Time Computing in the Solaris ™ Operating Environment.

To further prove the maturity of Solaris' real-time features, this document was written in the Solaris 8 time frame.&nbsp; It was copyrighted in 2000.</font></p></blockquote><p>So why not give Solaris more consideration?&nbsp; It's way more mature.&nbsp; And in the unlikely event (chcukle, chuckle) that a lower-latency OS might not solve all your performance problems, I'd put my money on Solaris and <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/" title="DTrace">DTrace</a> over anything Linux could offer in finding the real problem.<br /></p>

<p>I am convinced that scientists will some day find an explanation for
my continual verbal ineptitude.&nbsp; It will probably be identified as a
sequence in our genome and they'll call it something like <i>The Verbal Regret Coefficient</i>.&nbsp;
We are all born with it, and we can't escape how it influences us
everyday.&nbsp; In advance of its discovery, I propose this definition: The
Verbal Regret Coefficient is that innate ensemble of dispositions which
guarantees that after uttering a number of words, you will regret
having said a certain percentage of them.&nbsp; <br /></p>
<p>My first choice for a name was<i> Regret Coefficient</i>,
but incredibly a quick search seems to indicate that the insurance
industry already uses that term.&nbsp;&nbsp; If my theory catches on -- and you'll know that when someone dedicates a wikipedia entry -- I
don't want to have to deal with copyright and trademark infringement.&nbsp;
So Verbal Regret Coefficient it is.</p>
<p>The Verbal Regret Coefficient
or VRC will ultimately be quantified, and like a cholesterol count,
we'll all be assigned a VRC value.&nbsp; Most will fall into an average
range, but there will be outliers.&nbsp; A high VRC manifests itself
behaviorally in many ways: some high VRC'ers are purposely
controversial, outspoken, brash or arrogant.&nbsp; While others simply fail
to think before they speak.&nbsp; In case you're wondering, I am one of
those outliers with a dangerously high VRC.&nbsp; Furthermore, I'm quite
sure I don't fit into the arrogant and controversial group.&nbsp; But it's
not all good news for those with a low VRC. &nbsp; Although low VRC'ers tend
not to say anything regrettable, they tend also not to say anything of
substance either.&nbsp; We call these people politicians.<br /></p>
<p>If the current social trend continues, we'll get away with blaming any verbal <i>faux pas</i>
to our VRC.&nbsp; They'll be VRC support groups and celebrity VRC rehabilitation clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or maybe we could avoid all this silliness and just heed the advice of
Mark Twain who once said:</p>
<blockquote><i><span class="body">It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.</span></i><br /></blockquote>
<p>But that is sooooo hard.&nbsp;</p>

BODY: 
<p>As Sun continues to avail more of its intellectual property to the
community, the advantages Sun employees have regarding access to
internal resources almost disappear.&nbsp; In fact now when attempting
to post questions to internal Sun mail aliases, I am often times
redirected to the community.&nbsp; The ramifications of this change hit me
square in the gut this summer.</p> 
  <p>Having stumbled upon an internal project investigating how Solaris might be minimized for
embedded use, I thought an interesting offshoot of this effort might be
to create a ZFS appliance.&nbsp; This device would boot from flash entirely
into RAM, and all state would be maintained by the ZFS volumes.&nbsp; Turns
out this may be a little more tricky than anticipated, and future ZFS
enhancements to Solaris (ZFS boot) may make this idea moot.</p> 
  <p>Based on an <a title="OpenSolaris ZFS discussion" href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa;jsessionid=59EB539300ABA51B51E57225AF3F5245?messageID=50448&amp;#50448">OpenSolaris ZFS discussion</a>
I initiated, observers went off and wrote about this topic elsewhere, some
predicting that Sun would be releasing embedded ZFS appliances.&nbsp; Whoa,
hold on there, not so fast.&nbsp; We have no plans (at least that I know of) to do any such thing.&nbsp; This was nothing more than a pet project of mine.&nbsp; Serves me right for announcing that I was a Sun employee.</p> 
  <p> But there was some good that came out of this dialog.&nbsp; In addition to learning
the valuable lesson of being careful what you write, interest in the notion of using Solaris as
an &quot;embedded&quot; OS was quite apparent.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a consequence,&nbsp; I thought it might make sense to
publish the basic framework used to create a custom Solaris
miniroot.&nbsp; Included below is the introduction section of the <a title="README" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/embedded_solaris/README.txt">README</a> file:&nbsp;<br /></p> 
  <blockquote><i>1.0 Introduction</i><br /><br /><i>With
the advent of Solaris 10 Update 1 and its migration to the grub(5)
bootloader, it becomes quite feasible and straightforward to consider
creating small footprint &quot;embedded&quot; versions of Solaris which boot
directly into RAM. This project is based upon work done by Shudong Zhou
to create a minimized Solaris for embedded use.&nbsp; The doc/ directory
contains some of the original documentation and scripts used to build
such an environment.</i><br /><br /><i>It is expected that entities may
want to provide further functionality and customizations to this
environment. In order to assist in this endeavor, the original work has
been enhanced to utilize the Java-based ant(1) build tool. For a
further description on how a miniroot image is created, see the section
on &quot;Understanding the ant(1) build process&quot;.</i></blockquote> 
  <p>You can download the framework <a title="here" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/embedded_solaris/eos_framework.zip">here</a></p> 
  <p>Miscellaneous notes:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>This
framework assumes availability of a standard Solaris distribution.&nbsp;
Although not confirmed, I suspect it may not be real hard to
augment for OpenSolaris.</li> 
    <li>The current framework produces a RAM resident version of Solaris that is about 60MB in size.&nbsp; Note: there is no windowing included.<br /></li> 
    <li>These
configs are system specific.&nbsp; The reference implementation for the
included framework is an iGoLogic i84810 motherboard.&nbsp; Some key specs
are:</li> 
    <ul> 
      <li>1 GHz Celeron Processor</li>

Hi Jim,

Thanks for posting this. I just did a build using SXCR b_54.
Besides changing the obvious '/Solaris_10/Product' type stuff 
to Sol 11 the only other changes I had to make were:

libcrypto.so.0.9.7 is now version 0.9.8 in SXCR

and

'network/pfil:default setprop general/enabled=false'
network/pfil:default is gone in SXCR.

Once that was fixed the build went off without a complaint.
I'm going to spend some time this weekend and attempt to get it
installed on some media (USB stick probably) and see if I can get it to boot.

After that, I'm thinking of trying to add something like microwindows (now called Nano-X
thanks to MS) or something similar.

I'm using a VIA EPIA-MII mainboard with basically the same specs as the board you
mention in this blog.

Very cool.

Thanks again,
~Mike

Mike,

Thanks for the confirming that the move to Nevada isn't too painful.  Note: I did play around a little with booting a minimal Solaris on a Mini-ITX Via motherboard.  The USB interface was painfully slow.  It took something like 8 minutes to boot from USB to RAM.  With newer hardware and better USB interfaces, this should be a lot better.

Just stumbled across this while looking for a ZFS NAS solution.  My Solaris experience is pretty limited, but I've got a NAS box (which atm I'm planning to use FreeNAS with) on the way based on the Asus Terminator C3 (Via C3 800mhz).  I'm planning to give this a shot as well, to see how difficult it might be to get it up and running on that hardware.

Quick question:  Is your flash boot solution over USB or ATA?  The setup I've got coming has an ATA-&gt;CF adapter included, and I'm wondering whether you might know if booting from this would work out of the box?  I've seen some commentary in the appliance discussions that seem to indicate there are issues here, but I wasn't sure if that's solely related to getting Solaris small enough?  Also, is the 60mb all that one will need on-disk for storage?

This solution can boot from both USB and flash.  I honestly don't know how the flash socket interfaces with the motherboard, only that the BIOS gives options to boot from flash or USB.  The trick is to get grub on either your USB and/or flash device.

As to whether you'll be able to boot right out of the box depends upon your system.  This boot image is definitely machine-specific.  Your system may require special device drivers, among others, which aren't included in this miniroot.

With regards to size, the image is approximately 60MB expanded.  Grub actually stores it as a compressed image, consequently it takes up only about 30MB on flash.  The image, plus the minimal Grub overhead is all that's needed.  In effect the flash or USB device, is read-only, much like the way a CD-ROM is used to install Solaris.  Once the image is booted, Solaris runs entirely from RAM.

way cool ... of course zfs is the best performance solution around as far as I'm aware so the ability to run in a small footprint is of great interest to us.  

If we wanted to have real-time performance, on contiguous files, what additional zfs changes would be required?

If we wanted real-time OS performance (and I know its been discussed and shot down many times at Sun), would porting onto a small fast posix kernel be doable with moderate effort?

Great work guys!

Hi Kim ... Just a few things.  (1) The included miniroot for this project does not supply ZFS functionality.  In my opinion it got a little to kludgy to implement for this version.  (2) I think your real-time/ZFS question would best be posed to the OpenSolaris ZFS community found on http://www.opensolaris.org.  (3) Does the soft real-time capabilities of Solaris not fit the bill at all?
