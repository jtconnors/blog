    <p> <big><b>Reduced Footprint Java SE: Bringing Java Standard
          Edition Down to Size</b></big><br>
      <small>By Jim Connors 26 March 2008</small><br>
    </p>
    <p>A <a href="reducing_your_java_se_runtime.html">previous blog
        post</a> demonstrated how you can, with minimal effort, lessen
      the disk footprint of a typical Java SE 5.0 runtime environment by
      about a third without violating the <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html">Java


        Standard Edition Licensing agreement</a>. That post focused
      primarily on removing optional files and compressing class library
      jar files.&nbsp; It turns out that with a little more
      engineering,&nbsp; there is significant opportunity for further
      space optimization.</p>
    <p>These additional savings involve more intimate knowledge of the
      inner workings of Java SE.&nbsp; Sun performs this engineering
      work and provides a series of <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/embedded-se/overview/index.html">reduced


        footprint versions of Java SE</a>, in binary form, for some of
      the most common embedded platforms.&nbsp; They include some of
      these enhancements:<sup>1</sup></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Headless configuration</b> - The inclusion of graphics
        subsystems like AWT and Swing comprise a large chunk of the Java
        SE footprint.&nbsp; If your device has no graphics capability
        (i.e. is headless) why would you need to include this
        functionality?&nbsp; Headless configurations:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Do not support keyboard or mouse input</li>
        <li>Cannot create windows or display graphics</li>
        <li>Throw a <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">HeadlessException</font>
          when a graphics API is called</li>
        <li>Still support a functional Java 2D API for printing and
          off-screen rendering</li>
        <li>Are still 100% Java SE compatible<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Eliminate client or server compiler</b> - Sun's Java SE
        implementations include two HotSpot compilers, tuned and
        designed for specific environments.&nbsp; The client compiler
        focuses on things like fast user interactivity and quick
        startup, while the server compiler's priority is on optimizing
        large, long-lived server applications.&nbsp; The Java SE VM can
        only use one of these compilers at a time, so removing the
        unused one can save considerable space.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Minimizes memory consumption</b> - Standard Java SE
        allocates RAM to house things like the JIT code cache and the
        object heap.&nbsp; By default, each one of these areas (and
        others) can be assigned 64 MB.&nbsp; In an embedded platform
        where the total amount of RAM might only be 64MB, Java SE will
        simply not have enough memory to run.&nbsp; Java SE Embedded on
        the other hand, will automatically adapt memory usage to the
        amount of available RAM.&nbsp; Consequently, 64MB is a
        reasonable amount of RAM for a large set of embedded Java
        applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Space vs. speed tradeoffs</b> - (1) Java SE implements a
        thread lookup table, which in layman's terms, helps save a few
        instructions when switching between Java threads.&nbsp; By
        eliminating this table, a couple of MBs of RAM can be spared
        from your application's working set. (2) Java SE also sets aside
        an area (mmap'ed) for loading jar files into random access
        memory, which as was explained to me, may help performance, but
        may also result in duplicate copies of jar files in
        memory.&nbsp; Removal of this area further reduces the Resident
        Set Size.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>An Example</b></p>
    <p>Following through with the exmaple in the last post., let's start
      with an unmodified version of <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase5-419410.html#jre-1.5.0_13-oth-JPR">Java


        SE 5.0 Update 13 for Linux/x86</a>.&nbsp; By default, the static
      footprint is approximately 88MB.<br>
    </p>
    <pre><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk ./jre1.5.0_13/</b><br>   88185&nbsp;&nbsp; ./jre1.5.0_13/</font><br></pre>
    After following the directions in the <a
      href="reducing_your_java_se_runtime.html">previous post</a>, we
    can pare it down to roughly 60MB.<br>
    <pre>   jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/</b><br>   59358   /tmp/jre1.5.0_13/ <br></pre>
    <p>Downloading <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/embedded-se/downloads/java-se-embedded-archive-1862184.html">Sun's

        reduced footprint version of Java SE for x86/Linux</a> yields:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; jimc@jalopy:/tmp&gt; <b>du -sk /tmp/jre1.5.0_10/</b><br>   31003   /tmp/jre1.5.0_10/<br></pre>
    <p>This version of the JRE is about one-third it's original size,
      and furthermore has been modified to use significantly less memory
      than the standard Java SE offerings.&nbsp; Note: we are comparing
      slightly different updates of Java SE 1.5 (update 13 vs. update
      10).&nbsp; They are indeed not identical but their differences
      should be considered, for the sake of argument, negligible.&nbsp;</p>
