    <p><b>Mimicking Java Flight Recorder Triggers Outside Java Mission
        Control</b><br>
      <i><small><small>By Jim Connors - 28 July 2017</small></small></i><br>
    </p>
    <p>As highlighted in&nbsp;<a
        href="using-java-flight-recorder-triggers.html">this previous
        article</a>, Java Flight Recorder <em><strong>triggers</strong></em>
      enable you&nbsp;to selectively dump&nbsp;detailed runtime
      information about your Java application when user-defined
      conditions are met.&nbsp; In order to take advantage of this
      powerful feature, you must&nbsp;create and enable trigger rules
      inside the Java Mission Control client.&nbsp; For one or a very
      small number of applications, using Java Mission Control might be
      acceptable, however&nbsp;if you need to manage a large number of
      applications, the notion of keeping a Mission Control
      client&nbsp;open for each application instance might not be very
      appealing or realistic.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, use of Flight Recorder triggers currently only
      works within the Mission Control client.&nbsp; So the question
      becomes, is it possible to&nbsp;mimic trigger-like behavior
      outside of Mission Control?&nbsp; This article aims to show how
      you can, with a simple <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/">JMX</a>
      client program and some scripting.&nbsp; The following <a
        href="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/README.txt">README.txt</a>
      file is part of the included framework&nbsp;and provides a
      reasonable description of its individual components.&nbsp; It also
      instructs the user as to how to run the demonstration.&nbsp; The
      framework is bundled as a NetNeans project and can be downloaded <a
        href="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/jmxclient.zip">here</a>.</p>
    <p>To cut to the chase, here's a simple example of how the framework
      might be used.&nbsp; For this example, we'll use a sample Java
      application called <em>Latencies</em>.&nbsp;This program has a
      deliberate flaw in that as the user increases the&nbsp;number of
      threads, the latency dramatically increases too.&nbsp; What we'd
      like to do is mimic a trigger which will result in a dump of the
      Java Flight Recorder information when our thread count crosses a
      certain threshold.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</p>
    <p>1. Unzip the <a href="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/jmxclient.zip">jmxclient.zip</a>
      file.&nbsp;For this example, we&nbsp;unzip the jmxclient.zip file
      in the d:\tmp directory, resulting in&nbsp;the creation of
      the&nbsp;d:\tmp\JMXClient directory.</p>
    <p>2. Start NetBeans and open up the JMXClient project that was just
      unzipped in the d:\tmp\JMXClient directory</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/openproject.jpg"
        width="602" height="315"></p>
    <p>3. Within NetBeans "Clean and Build" the JMXClient project.<br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/cleanandbuild.jpg"
      width="469" height="362"><br>
    <br>
    4. The previous step creates a D:\tmp\JMXClient\dist
    directory.&nbsp; Change to the dist/ directory and run the
    Latencies.bat script from a CMD shell:<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="" src="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/startlatencies.jpg"
      width="613" height="331"><br>
    <br>
    <p>Let's take a look at the command-line options associated with
      running the Latencies program:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999
          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false - </strong>this
        enables an agent to remotely monitor, via JMX, the Latencies
        program at port 9999.</li>
      <li><strong>-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+FlightRecorder</strong>
        - these two options <em>must</em> be added to enable the Flight
        Recorder capability.</li>
      <li><strong>-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=defaultrecording=true</strong>
        - this puts the Latencies program in Flight Recorder <em>continuous



          recording mode</em>, that is to say, telemetry data will
        continuously be recorded and stored in a circular buffer.&nbsp;
        At any point in time, through a variety of means, the Flight
        Recorder data can be dumped to a file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>5. With the Latencies program running, open up another CMD shell
      and start the JMXClientThreadCount.bat script.</p>
    <img alt=""
      src="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/startjmxclientthreadcount.jpg"
      width="620" height="335"><br>
    <br>
    <p>Again, let's examine the command-line arguments to this program:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>D:\Oracle\jdk8\bin\java.exe -cp JMXClient.jar
          com.example.jmxclient.JMXClientThreadCount</strong> -
        com.example.JMXClientThreadCount is the Java main class found in
        JMXClient.jar</li>
      <li><strong>-debug</strong> - logs debug information to the
        console.&nbsp; Among the information displayed is the URL
        (hostname and port number) it uses to connect to the JMX server
        (the Latencies program), and additionally it logs the value of
        the ThreadCount MBean each time the program polls that
        information.</li>
      <li><strong>-interval:2000</strong> - instructs the program to
        poll the value of the ThreadCount bean every 2 seconds (2000
        milliseconds)</li>
      <li><strong>-threshold:20</strong> - instructs the program to
        terminate when the ThreadCount value exceeds 20.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>6. With both programs running, return back to the Latencies
      window and hit &lt;Enter&gt; 4 or 5 times to add additional
      threads to the program.</p>
    <img alt="" src="resource/mimic_jfr_triggers/hitenter.jpg"
      width="598" height="327"><br>
    <br>
    7. Now take a look at the JMXClientThreadCount.bat window.&nbsp; It
    should have caused the thread count to exceed the specified
    threshold value of 20, resulting in a "trigger" that dumps the
    Flight Recorder contents to a file called Latencies.jfr.&nbsp; With
    that file, you can now examine the inner workings of the Latencies
    program with the Java Mission Control utility.<br>
