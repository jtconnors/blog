      <p><small>After blogging about the <a
            href="real_time_java_and_high.html">relationship between
            high resolution timers and Java RTS</a>, a comment was
          posted by a reader stating that they couldn't use Java RTS 2.0
          with the latest Solaris 10 update.&nbsp; Unfortunately that
          reader was correct.</small></p>
      <p><small>At the time of the post, Sun had released Solaris 10
          Update 4, while Java RTS 2.0 would only support Solaris 10
          update 3.&nbsp; To further exacerbate the situation, once Sun
          releases a new version of Solaris, they do their best to
          encourage users to use the latest version by making it
          difficult (if not impossible) for them to locate previous
          update versions.</small></p>
      <p><small>There is a dependency between the aforementioned high
          resolution timer interface and Solaris which is update
          specific.&nbsp; We're working to rectify this situation, but
          as the process behind Solaris is deliberately bureaucratic,
          this might take a while.&nbsp; In the interim we'll need to
          keep in better lock step with Solaris releases.</small></p>
      <p><small>On November 27, Java RTS 2.0 update 1 was
          released:&nbsp;</small></p>
      <ul>
        <li><small>It supports the latest Solaris 10 update (called
            08/07 or update 4)</small></li>
        <li><small>Support for Java SE has been updated to Java SE 5
            update 13<br>
          </small></li>
        <li><small>A new Java <a

              DTrace Provider</a> is available</small></li>
