    <p>As embedded processor designs continue their inexorable drive
      towards ever increasing capability, the natural desire to utilize
      more robust software platforms, previously reserved for powerful
      desktop computers and servers, follows suit.&nbsp; Recognizing
      this trend, a version of the Java Standard Edition platform,
      called <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/overview/index.html">Java



        SE Embedded</a>, has been developed to address this growing
      market.&nbsp; In addition to bringing all of the benefits of the
      ubiquitous Java Standard Edition to the most popular embedded
      processors, static footprint and memory optimizations have been
      realized.&nbsp; To get a feel for some of the space savings, check

    <p>Partly due to the turmoil surrounding the Oracle acquisition of
      Sun, a refresh of the Java SE Embedded binaries took longer than
      anticipated.&nbsp; The new versions are now available for <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/index.html">download</a>
      with these <a

        configurations</a>.&nbsp; During that time frame, Java SE-E
      engineers were able take care of some internal housekeeping which
      should help for better synchronization of future releases of Java
      SE with Java SE-E.&nbsp; In the past, Java SE-E engineers would
      take a snapshot of the Java Standard Edition code and incorporate
      their modifications to create a new release, forking from the
      standard edition source,.&nbsp; Now, the Java SE-E code is part of
      the overall Java SE project, such that future Java SE enhancements
      and bug fixes should now be automatically incorporated into the
      Java SE-E code base.</p>
    <p>The refreshed Java SE-E binaries are based on the Java SE 6
      Update 21, and represent substantial security, performance and
      quality enhancements.&nbsp; Benchmark tests show that, for
      example, simply replacing the previous versions of the Java SE-E
      virtual machines with the latest binaries produces on averageimg
      about 20% performance gain for the same hardware/OS
      combination.&nbsp; Having recently introduced a Just-In-Time (or
      JIT) compiler to the Android Dalvik Virtual Machine, we thought it
      would be an interesting exercise to compare performance of Java
      SE-E to Android on identical hardware.&nbsp; For a full
      explanation of the results and methodology, check out <a

        Vandette's blog</a> on this topic.&nbsp; To cut to the chase,
      for the selected benchmarks, Java SE-E outperforms Android by a
      factor of two.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Improving virtual machine performance is a tedious process that
      takes time.&nbsp; The bottom line is this:&nbsp; Java SE Virtual
      Machine engineers have been at this for a very long time, and have
      had the benefit of fifteen years of scrutiny from the computer
      science community.&nbsp; It will take considerable time and effort
      for Android to come close to this capability.&nbsp; In the
      interim, the Java Virtual Machine performance and quality
      improvement marches on.<br>

      look at these pictures.&nbsp; Based upon Marvell's Plug Computer
      design, these amazing devices pack a 1+GHz Arm processor with
      512MB RAM and consume a minuscule 5 watts of power. They run Java
      SE-E beautifully.&nbsp; Combined with an IDE like <a
        href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>, this makes for an
      ideal, although unofficial, Java SE Embedded Development Kit.<br>
