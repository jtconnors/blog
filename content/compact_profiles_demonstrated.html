    <big><b>Compact Profiles Demonstrated</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 12 August 2013</small></small><br>
    <p> Following up on an <a href="a_first_look_at_compact.html">article



        introducing compact profiles</a>, the video that follows
      demonstrates how this new feature in the upcoming Java 8 release
      can be utilized.&nbsp; The video:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Describes the compact profile feature and the rationale for
        its creation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Shows how to use the new <tt>jrecreate</tt> utility to
        generate compact profiles that can be readily deployed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Demonstrates that even the smallest of profiles (less than
        11MB) is robust enough to support very popular and important
        software frameworks like OSGi.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> The software demonstrated is in early access.&nbsp; For those
      interested in trying it out before the formal release of Java 8,
      there are two options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Members of the Oracle Partner Network (OPN) with a gold
        membership or higher can download the early access Java 8
        binaries of Java SE-Embedded shown here.&nbsp; For those not at
        this level, it may still be possible to get early access
        software, but it will require a qualification process
        beforehand.</li>
      <li>It's not as intimidating as it sounds, you can pull down the
        source code for OpenJDK 8, and <a
href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/raw-file/tip/README-builds.html">build



          it yourself</a>.&nbsp; By default, compact profiles are not
        built, but <a
href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8-dev/2013-February/002062.html">this



          forum post shows you how</a>.&nbsp; The reference platform for
        this software is linux/x86.&nbsp; Functionally, the generated
        compact profiles will contain the pared down modules for each
        compact profile, but you'll find the footprint for each to be
        much larger than the ones demonstrated in this video, as none of
        the Java SE-Embedded space optimizations are performed by
        default.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Not having any premium privileges on YouTube, the maximum allowed
      length of a video is 15 minutes.&nbsp; There's actually lots more
      to talk about with compact profiles, including enhancements to
      java tools and utilities (<tt>javac</tt>, <tt>jar</tt>, <tt>jdeps</tt>,
      and the <tt>java</tt> command itself) that have incorporated
      intelligence for dealing with profiles.</p>
    <p>Hmm.&nbsp; Maybe there's an opportunity for a <i>Compact
        Profiles Demonstrated Part II</i>?<br>
