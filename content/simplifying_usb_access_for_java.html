    <p>One of the challenges in creating the content for the <a
href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2097">Java



        One 2014 Java SE Embedded Internet of Things Hands-on-Lab</a>
      concerned interacting, via Java and OSGi, with a USB temperature
      sensor. &nbsp; Unfortunately a USB communications API is not part
      of the Java SE standard (as of this post: Halloween 2014).&nbsp;
      So the question is, how can Java/USB communication be established,
      and furthermore and how does this work within the OSGi framework?<br>
      <br>

    <p>In looking around at some of the available options, we chose the
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/">javahidapi</a> as
      the basis for this connectivity.&nbsp; As a Java/JNI wrapper
      around the <a href="http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/">C/C++ HID
        API for Linux, MacOS X and Windows</a>, the appeal behind this
      API is that using it does not require the use of a custom driver
      for each device on each platform.</p>
    <p>In order to operate within an OSGi framework (in this case Apache
      Felix 4.4), javahidapi's open source code has been slightly
      modified/enhanced. The end result is that an OSGi bundle is
      available that can be dropped into standard OSGi frameworks to
      support USB communication for HID devices.&nbsp; It does contain a
      native component, and for the sake of simplicity, we've decided to
      include a separate jar file for each supported architecture.&nbsp;
      For the OSGi enthusiast, here's what the generated <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt>
      file looks like for the Linux/armhf (suitable for the Raspberry
      Pi) architecture: </p>
    <p><tt>Manifest-Version: 1.0<br>

        Tool: Bnd-1.50.0</tt></p>
    <p>Here are some pre-built hidapi OSGi bundles for popular Linux
      platforms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a
          href="resource/Java_USB/com.codeminders.hidapi-armhf-1.0.jar.zip">com.codeminders.hidapi-armhf-1.0.jar</a>
        (ARMv6 hard float - Suitable for Raspberry Pi)</li>
      <li><a
          href="resource/Java_USB/com.codeminders.hidapi-armv5tel-1.0.jar.zip">com.codeminders.hidapi-armv5tel-1.0.jar</a>
        (ARMv5- Suitable for Plug Computers)</li>
      <li><a
          href="resource/Java_USB/com.codeminders.hidapi-x86-1.0.jar.zip">com.codeminders.hidapi-x86-1.0.jar</a>
        (Linux/x86 32-bit)</li>
      <li><a
          href="resource/Java_USB/com.codeminders.hidapi-x86_64-1.0.jar.zip">com.codeminders.hidapi-x86_64-1.0.jar</a>
        (Linux/x86 64-bit)</li>
      <li><a
          href="resource/Java_USB/com.codeminders.hidapi-quark-1.0.jar.zip">com.codeminders.hidapi-quark-1.0.jar</a>
        (Linux/x86 Intel Quark processor)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get a feel for the changes made to the original source, here's
      what was done:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A NetBeans project was created under the Maven-&gt;OSGi Bundle
        category</li>
      <li>The Java source code for <a
          href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/">javahidapi</a> was
        placed in the project's <tt>src/main/java/com/codeminders/hidapi</tt>
        directory<br>
      </li>
      <li>The architecture specific native library was placed in the
        project's <tt>src/main/resources/native/linux/<em><strong>architecture</strong></em></tt>
        directory.&nbsp; For example, the Linux/x86 version of the
        project places the <tt>libhidapi-jni-32.so</tt> file in the <tt>src/main/resources/native/linux/x86</tt>
        directory.</li>
      <li>An <a href="resource/Java_USB/Activator.java"><tt>Activator.java</tt></a>
        class was added in the project's <tt>src/main/java/com/codeminders/hidapi</tt>
        directory.&nbsp; In OSGi, the <tt>start()</tt> method in this
        class gets called when this bundle is activated.&nbsp; It is
        specified in the bundle's <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file.</li>
      <li>The original <a
          href="resource/Java_USB/ClassPathLibraryLoader.java">ClassPathLibraryLoader.java</a>
        file was simplified and is currently only appropriate for Linux
        deployments.<br>
      </li>
      <li>As this is a Maven-based project, the project's <tt>pom.xml</tt>
        file was edited (<a href="resource/Java_USB/pom.xml">here's what
          the x86 version looks like</a>), such that at build time it
        will generate a <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file similar to the one
        referenced above.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And here are the associated NetBeans Projects which can be used
      to build the 4 bundles referenced above.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="resource/Java_USB/hidapi_armhf.zip">hidapi_armhf</a></li>
      <li><a
          href="resource/Java_USB/com.codeminders.hidapi-armv5tel-1.0.jar.zip">hidapi_armv5tel</a></li>
      <li><a href="resource/Java_USB/hidapi_x86.zip">hidapi_x86</a></li>
      <li><a href="resource/Java_USB/hidapi_x86_64.zip">hidapi_x86_64</a></li>
      <li><a href="resource/Java_USB/hidapi_quark.zip">hidapi_quark</a>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    If you'd like to extend this template to include OSGi bundles for
    additional architectures, you can start with one of the projects
    above, clone it, and make the appropriate changes for your new
    environment.&nbsp; If the native javahidapi component for your new
    platform is not available, you'll have to <a
      href="https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/downloads">pull down the
      source for hidapi</a> and build it for inclusion into your
    project.&nbsp; If anyone is interested in going through this
    exercise, I'd be glad to post the fruits of their labor here.<br>
