    Java RTS 2.2 Early Access 2 Released<br>
    By Jim Connors 9 September 2009<br>
    <p> Sun recently announced the availability of a second edition of
      its Java Real-Time System (Java RTS) version 2.2 Early
      Access.&nbsp; In a <a href="early_access_version_of_java.html">previous


        blog post</a>, many of the important new features of this
      release were highlighted.&nbsp; But I felt compelled to jot down a
      few additional words, not only because there's a newer version of
      the software to evaluate, but because there's one interesting
      component that deserves a little more exposure.</p>
    <p>I spent some time today speaking with my compadre, Eric Bruno,
      author of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Java-Programming-RTS/dp/0137142986/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1251922771&amp;sr=8-2"><i><b>Real-Time


            Java Programming: With Java RTS</b></i></a>.&nbsp; He clued
      me in on the fact that our engineers have performed the daunting
      task of backporting the JDK 7 client compiler onto Java RTS
      2.2.&nbsp; The engineering team is particularly proud of this
      feat, and ought to be.&nbsp; It not only enhances Java RTS
      performance, it also enables them to better stay in lock step with
      the latest client hotspot VM developments, something the latest
      Java SE 6 releases may not entirely do.&nbsp; For some insight
      into the engineering trade-offs associated creating this latest
      version of Java RTS, check out <a
