    <p><b>Bitcoin Mining: Six Months Later</b><small><small><br>
          By Jim Connors 28 February 2018<br>
        </small></small></p>
    <p>About six months have passed since first setting up a personal
      Bitcoin mining rig.&nbsp; As a follow up to that&nbsp;<u><a
          href="and_now_for_something_comletely.html">original post</a></u>,&nbsp;I









      thought it make make sense to return to see what's transpired
      during this brief -- and tumultuous -- period, and to discuss
      adjustments made to the rig.</p>

    <p><strong>What's Changed in the Bitcoin Universe?</strong></p>
    <p>In a word, a lot (actually that's two words, but who's counting).
      Here are just a few trends:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Bitcoin price volatility shows no signs of slowing down
          even as its market cap grows dramatically</i>.&nbsp; After the
        price of Bitcoin had nearly qunitupled from September to
        December 2017, it has since lost half its value in the
        subsequent two months.</li>
      <li><em>Mining is taking place on an even more massive scale</em>.&nbsp;












        Take a look at <u><a

        and <u><a

        In Russia, <u><a

            were arrested for using top secret nuclear supercomputer
            facilities to mine cryptocurrencies</a></u>.</li>
      <li><em>The worldwide Bitcoin hash rate has tripled in the last
          six months,&nbsp;</em>meaning the competition for mining
        Bitcoins is getting more and more intense. Here's a<a

      <li><em>My mining pool, <u><a href="https://slushpool.com/home/">slushpool</a></u>,
          has increased its Bitcoin hash rate capacity by ten fold</em>,
        meaning without any increase in hash rate capacity on my end, my
        take of slushpool's winnings would be 1/10th what it originally
        was.</li>
      <li>China is <u><a

            its crackdown on cryptocurrency trading</a></u>. As it and
        other countries consider regulating this industry, further
        uncertainties surrounding Bitcoin are sure to arise.</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="rig20"></a>
    <p><strong>My Humble Bitcoin Mining Rig (version 2.0)</strong></p>
    <p>Here's what the new version of the rig looks like.&nbsp; The
      original rig can be viewed <u><a
          href="and_now_for_something_comletely.html#rig">here</a></u>.&nbsp;












      Following is a description of the modifications.</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="resource/bitcoin/Rig2.jpg" style="width: 850px;
        height: 685px;" height="2970"></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Raspberry Pi 3</strong>: Even with the new and
        improved hash rate this rig provides, the Raspberry Pi 3 still
        has more than enough horsepower to serve as the overall
        controller.&nbsp; The big change to the controller involves the
        addition of the <a
          href="http://www.xtronix.co.uk/raspberry-pi-poe.htm"><u>Xtronix












            Power over Ethernet (PoE) Adapter for the Raspberry Pi</u></a>.&nbsp;












        With PoE, it's now possible to remotely reset the power on this
        rig.&nbsp; In the <em>Configuration Changes</em> section of
        this article, software modifications have been made which make
        this platform much more reliable.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the ability
        to remotely hard reset the rig does come in handy occasionally.</li>
      <li><strong>GekkoScience 2-pac (BM 1348x2) USB Bitcoin Miners</strong>:&nbsp;












        The number of USB ASIC miners has been doubled from 4 to
        8.&nbsp; Running at 225Mhz, this rig now averages about 200 Gh/s
        (200 Billion hashes per second).&nbsp; The power consumption
        stands at about 100 Watts, roughly equivalent to an old school
        incandescent light bulb.</li>
      <li><strong>HooToo 60W 7-port powered USB hubs</strong>: To
        accommodate the additional USB ASIC miners, two USB hubs have
        been added.&nbsp; All four USB ports on the Raspberry Pi 3 are
        now occupied.</li>
      <li><strong>Artic Breeze USB fans</strong>: An extra USB fan was
        added to assure all miners are cooled adequately.</li>
    </ol>
    <a name="config"></a>
    <p><strong>Configuration Changes</strong></p>
    <p>After running without incident for weeks, the Raspberry Pi began
      occasionally locking up, rendering it unusable until a hard reset
      was performed.&nbsp; A search yielded this <a
        href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=55370"><u>thread</u></a>,
      where it appears others were experiencing similar problems.&nbsp;
      Related to kernel memory corruption, a two-fold solution was
      employed to minimize the downtime associated with this tricky
      problem:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enable&nbsp;<u><a
            href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/slub.txt">SLUB












            debugging</a></u> in the Raspian kernel.&nbsp; Although this
        requires the Linux kernel to consume more CPU cycles, a large
        number of these intermittent memory allocation errors will be
        caught.&nbsp; In order to configure and enable SLUB debugging,
        as <tt>root</tt> add the following line to the <tt>/boot/cmdline.txt</tt>
        file: <strong><tt>slub_debug=FPUZ</tt></strong> and reboot.</li>
      <li>Configure in a watchhdog daemon.&nbsp; Many processors come
        equipped with a watchdog timer which simply counts down from
        some set value to zero.&nbsp; In order to prevent it from
        reaching zero, the system must periodically reset the watchdog
        timer.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the timer reaches zero, it is assumed the
        system has hung.&nbsp; The watchdog daemon detects this
        condition and can be configured to reboot when this occurs,
        lessening the need for manual intervention.&nbsp; This procedure
        is typically hardware, Operating System and version
        dependent.&nbsp; One way to enable the watchdog reset feature
        for a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Jessie is to&nbsp;<u><a
            href="resource/bitcoin/watchdog-reset-jessie.txt">follow
            these instructions</a></u>.</li>
    </ol>
    <a name="return"></a>
    <p><strong>Return on Investment?&nbsp; Really?</strong></p>
    <p>Even though the price of Bitcoin has risen by about 2<span>Â½</span>
      times its September 2017 value and my mining rig has doubled in
      capacity, those substantial gains cannot offset the tremendous
      increase in worldwide mining capacity.&nbsp; Taking this
      point-in-time analysis with a grain of salt, the average current
      daily yield in Bitcoins for my rig (as of 26-Feb-2018) is
      .00001677.&nbsp; Multiplied by the current price ($10,158 US)
      results in a daily reward of $0.17 US a day.&nbsp; That's two
      cents a day more than the original setup but with double the power
      requirements (100 Watts vs. 50 Watts), not to mention the capital
      costs of the additional equipment. So to repurpose the punchline
      from an old joke: "<em>we're losing money on every transaction and
        making it up in volume</em>".</p>
