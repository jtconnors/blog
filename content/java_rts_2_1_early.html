    <p>Java RTS 2.1 EA (Early Access) marks the arrival of a commitment
      made some time back, namely that Sun would provide a version of
      the Java Real-Time System for Linux.&nbsp; Perhaps to some, it was
      long time in the making, but in fact there are at least 2 good
      reasons why a Linux version wasn't available till now:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Until recently, there was no standard Linux release/kernel
        which had true real-time support.&nbsp; Typically the versions
        available were non-standard and did not constitute any
        considerable volume.&nbsp; Mainstream Linux distributions are
        only now incorporating the necessary real-time underpinnings.</li>
      <li>Porting the Java Real-Time System VM to additional platforms
        is non-trivial.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Support and testing for Java RTS 2.1 EA at this time is limited
      to the currently shipping <a title="Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.0"
        href="http://www.novell.com/products/realtime/">SUSE Linux
        Enterprise Real Time10</a> platform and the upcoming <a
        title="Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.0"
        href="http://www.redhat.com/mrg">Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.0</a>
      release.&nbsp; It is however possible that other versions of Linux
      could run Java RTS 2.1 EA as it utilizes the real-time POSIX
      programming interface.&nbsp; At minimum they would require a
      2.6.21 kernel or greater and a glibc of 2.5 or greater.&nbsp; In
      addition, the latest RT patch would also be needed.</p>
    <p>This announcement pertains only to Linux, but of course a 2.1 EA
      version for both Solaris x86/x64 and Sparc will be shortly
      forthcoming. In the interim, a version of Java RTS 2.0 update 1 is
      readily available.&nbsp; Documentation for both Java RTS 2.0 and
      2.1 EA can be found <a title="here"

    <p>Regardless of platform, an evaluation version of the software is
      available for download at the <a title="Java RTS download page"
