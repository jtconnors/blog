    <big><b>The $5 Raspberry Pi</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 25 January 2016</small></small><br>
    <p> Less than a year after the introduction of the <a
        href="welcome_raspberry_pi_2.html">Raspberry Pi 2</a>, the
      Raspberry Pi foundation has once again outdone itself with yet
      another landmark product launch: the <i>Raspberry Pi Zero</i>.</p>

    <p align="left">The Raspberry Pi Zero is truly revolutionary.&nbsp;
      At 40% the size of the original Pi, it consumes less than half of
      the power, and can be configured <a
href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-zero-conserve-energy">to



        draw as little as 80mA</a>. It has a faster processor than the
      original (Java performance graph below), and maintains binary
      compatibility with previous generations.&nbsp; And with a list
      price of $5US, the dream of offering serious computing power to
      nearly anyone on the planet comes ever closer to reality.&nbsp;
      Here are a some of the high level features:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 GHz ARM11 Broadcom BCM2835 processor </li>
      <li>512MB RAM</li>
      <li>Micro-SD card slot</li>
      <li>Multiple Linux distributions available plus support for
        Windows 10<br>
      </li>
      <li>Mini-HDMI socket for 1080p video<br>
      </li>
      <li>Micro-USB sockets for data and power</li>
      <li>GPIO header (unpopulated).&nbsp; Pinout the same as Model
        A+/B+/2B </li>
      <li>Composite video header (unpopulated)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p align="left">At the time of this article's creation (Jan 2016),
      availability is limited, as the first shipment sold out quite
      rapidly (no surprise there).&nbsp; I was able to procure my Pi
      Zero on the black market.&nbsp; That is to say I bought it on eBay
      at a substantial uplift.</p>
    <p align="left">In terms of Java performance, the chart that follows
      compares SPECjvm2008 benchmark results for a Raspberry Pi and a
      Raspberry Pi Zero utilizing the latest available Oracle JDK
      (1.8.0_71).&nbsp; The larger the number, the better, the Pi Zero
      outperforms the original by 45%.</p>

    <p align="left">Another feel-good aspect to this story is that the
      Pi Zero will be manufactured in Wales.&nbsp; Here's hoping that in
      the near future supplies will meet the pent up demand.&nbsp; <br>
