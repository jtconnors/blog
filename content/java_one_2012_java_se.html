    </p>
    <p>After successful runs at Java One 2011 San Francisco and Tokyo,
      The Java SE Embedded Hands On Lab returns for Java One 2012.&nbsp;
      If you're attending the Java One event in San Francisco (Sept 30 -
      Oct 4), please consider signing up for this session.&nbsp; As an
      added incentive, we will be raffling off a couple of the Plug
      Computer devices that you'll gain experience with during this
      lab.&nbsp; Seating is limited to 100 students, so register early.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here's an overview:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>This hands-on lab aims to show that developers already
          familiar with the Java develop/debug/deploy lifecycle can
          apply those same skills to develop Java applications, using
          Java SE Embedded, on embedded devices. The participants in the
          lab will:</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Have their own individual embedded device so they can
            gain valuable hands-on experience</i></li>
        <li><i>Turn their embedded device into a web container, using
            off-the-shelf software</i></li>
        <li><i> Learn how to deploy embedded Java applications,
            developed with an IDE, onto their device</i></li>
        <li><i>Learn how embedded Java applications can be remotely
            debugged from their desktop IDE</i></li>
        <li><i>Learn how to remotely monitor and manage embedded Java
            applications from their desktop</i></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, 2012 marks the first year that we will have a venue
      specifically tailored for the Java embedded community.&nbsp;
      Entitled <i><b>Java Embedded @ Java One</b></i>,&nbsp; this event
      takes place during the JavaOne/OpenWorld week in San Francisco on
      October 3-4.&nbsp; To Quote from the <a
        href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/embedded/index.html">Java
        Embedded @ Java One URL</a>:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>The conference will feature dedicated business-focused
          content from Oracle discussing how Java Embedded delivers a
          secure, optimized environment ideal for multiple network-based
          devices, as well as meaningful industry-focused sessions from
          peers who are already successfully utilizing Java Embedded.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So if you want to participate in what many consider to be the
      next big trend in computing -- the internet of things -- come join
      us 10/3-4 in San Francisco.<br>
