    <p>Java SE is a very impressive platform indeed, but with all that
      functionality comes a large and ever increasing footprint.&nbsp;
      It stands to reason then that one of the more frequent requests
      from the community has been the desire to deploy only those
      components required for a particular application instead of the
      entire Java SE runtime environment.&nbsp; Referred to as
      subsetting, the benefits of such a concept would seem to be many:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A smaller Java environment would require less compute
        resources, thus opening up a new domain of devices previously
        thought to be too humble for Java.</li>
      <li>A smaller runtime environment could be better optimized for
        performance and start up time.</li>
      <li>Elimination of unused code is always a good idea from a
        security perspective.</li>
      <li>If the environment could be pared down significantly, there
        may be tremendous benefit to bundling runtimes with each
        individual Java application.</li>
      <li>These bundled applications could be downloaded more quickly.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite these perceived advantages, the platform stewards (Sun,
      then Oracle) have been steadfast in their resistance to
      subsetting.&nbsp; The rationale for such a stance is quite simple:
      there was sincere concern that the Java SE platform would
      fragment.&nbsp; Agree or disagree, the Java SE standard has
      remained remarkably in tact over time.&nbsp; If you need any
      further evidence of this assertion, compare the state of Java SE
      to that of Java ME, particularly in the mobile telephony
      arena.&nbsp; Better still, look how quickly Android has spawned
      countless variants in its brief lifespan.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, a formal effort has been underway having the stated
      goal of providing a much more modular Java platform.&nbsp; Called
      <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/">Project Jigsaw</a>,
      when complete, Java SE will be composed of a set of finer-grained
      modules and will include tools to enable developers to identify
      and isolate only those modules needed for their application.&nbsp;
      However, implementing this massive internal change and yet
      maintaining compatibility has proven to be a considerable
      challenge.&nbsp; Consequently <a
        href="http://mreinhold.org/blog/late-for-the-train">full
        implementation of the modular Java platform has been delayed
        until Java 9</a>.</p>
    <p>Understanding that Java 9 is quite a ways off, an interim
      solution will be available for Java 8, called <b><a
          href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161">Compact Profiles</a></b>.&nbsp;



      Rather than specifying a complete module system, Java 8 will
      define subset profiles of the Java SE platform specification that
      developers can use to deploy.&nbsp; At the current time three
      compact profiles have been defined, and have been assigned the
      creative names <i>compact1</i>, <i>compact2</i>, and <i>compact3</i>.
      The table that follows lists the packages that comprise each of
      the profiles.&nbsp; Each successive profile is a superset of its
      predecessor.&nbsp; That is to say, the compact2 profile contains
      all of the packages in compact1 plus those listed under the
      compact2 column below.&nbsp; Likewise, compact3 contains all of
      compact2 packages plus the ones listed in the compact3 column.<br>

    <p>You may ask what savings can be realized by using compact
      profiles?&nbsp; As Java 8 is in pre-release stage, numbers will
      change over time, but let's take a look at a snapshot early access
      build of Java SE-Embedded 8 for ARMv5/Linux.&nbsp; <i>A
        reasonably configured compact1 profile comes in at less than
        14MB</i>.&nbsp; Compact2 is about 18MB and compact3 is in the
      neighborhood of 21MB.&nbsp; For reference, the latest Java 7u21 SE
      Embedded ARMv5/Linux environment requires 45MB.</p>
    <p>So at less than one-third the original size of the already
      space-optimized Java SE-Embedded release, you have a very capable
      runtime environment.&nbsp; If you need the additional
      functionality provided by the compact2 and compact3 profiles or
      even the full VM, you have the option of deploying your
      application with them instead.</p>
    <p>In the next installment, we'll look at Compact Profiles in a bit
      more detail.<br>
