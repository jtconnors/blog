    <big><b>You Are What You Eat?</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 11 May 2009</small></small><br>

    So you may ask, what effect does the food we eat have on our blood
    pressure?&nbsp; My experience, documented below, won't likely hold
    up to whole lot of scientific scrutiny, but it's good enough lesson
    for me.
    <p>A combination of poor eating habits and genetics lands me in that
      ever-increasing group of individuals who have high blood
      pressure.&nbsp; At first I was what you might consider borderline
      hypertensive.&nbsp; Being thin and active, in conjunction with my
      doctor, we only monitored my levels to make sure they didn't get
      worse.&nbsp; Unfortunately they did.</p>
    <p>In an attempt at avoiding medication, I started seriously
      watching my sodium intake.&nbsp; The resulting change in blood
      pressure was noticeable in pretty short order.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the
      table below for daily readings for the last two weeks.&nbsp; In
      general, I try to take my reading at or around 8:00AM if possible.</p>
    <p>Having spent my whole life eating pretty much what I please, it's
      not easy to make this lifestyle change.&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the
      help of loved ones, things have been going quite well.&nbsp; But
      then came Mother's day (5/10).&nbsp;&nbsp; A combination of brunch
      with my parents and dinner with my in-laws put the kabash on any
      diet plans.&nbsp; I knew this would happen, and was frankly
      looking forward to the feast.&nbsp; It only took one day for my
      pressure to skyrocket.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; But man did I enjoy
      eating the waffles, bacon, crumbcake, bagels, Mimosas (Orange
      Juice and Champagne) cookies, macaroni, meatballs, turkey,
      chocoloate cake, Coke, Espresso, wine, Sambuca and Cognac to name
      a few.<br>
