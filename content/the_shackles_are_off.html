    <p>Today marks an important milestone for JavaFX 2.0.&nbsp; Prior to
      this date, only a select few partners had early access privilege
      to the technology, and for good reason.&nbsp; During that early
      access period, the API was in a very fluid state, and from
      personal experience I can tell you that changes to the JavaFX 2.0
      API were done almost on a build-by-build basis.&nbsp; The
      announcement of a public beta not only makes the software
      available worldwide, but also signals that the JavaFX 2.0 API is
      on much more solid footing.</p>
    <p>So check out <a

        location</a> for the latest JavaFX 2.0 information.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Three software downloads are now available:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>JavaFX 2.0 Beta SDK</b> - the JavaFX functionality needed
        to develop directly via the command line or with other tools</li>
      <li><b>JavaFX 2.0 Beta Runtime</b> - the runtime environment
        required for running JavaFX 2.0 applications&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b>JavaFX 2.0 Beta Plugin for NetBeans IDE 7.0</b> -&nbsp; for
        building, previewing, and debugging JavaFX applications in
        NetBeans 7.<br>

    </ol>
