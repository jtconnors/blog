          Access jpackage Utility<br>
        </b><small>by Jim Connors - 4 March 2019</small><b><br>

    <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a
          href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343"><span class="s2">JEP-343</span></a>
        (Java Enhancement Proposal 343) specifies the introduction and
        formal inclusion of an application packaging utility called <tt>jpackage</tt>
        into a future JDK.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span class="s1"><span
          class="s1">Based on an earlier version of the JavaFX <tt>javapackager</tt>
          program, </span>the goal of this tool is to provide native
        packaging options for Java applications on Windows, MacOS and
        Linux. From an end-user perspective, once Java applications have
        been packaged up with <tt>jpackage</tt>, installation
        experience should be no different than installing any other
        native app.<span>&nbsp; </span>An early access, (and admittedly
        incomplete) build of </span><span class="s3">OpenJDK 13</span><span
        class="s1"> is now available for those who wish to experiment
        with this new feature.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">As examples of this new utility are
        currently in scant supply, the video that follows walks through
        the process of taking a sample Java application and creating a
        native installer on MacOS for that program.</span></p>

    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a few short steps, the application
        source code is pulled from GitHub, built and packaged.<span>&nbsp;


        </span>For those that wish to duplicate this demonstration, they
        can do so with the following prerequisites:</span></p>
    <ol class="ol1">
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Have a version of JDK 11 or later
          (either <a
href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html"><span
              class="s5">Oracle JDK</span></a> or <a
            href="https://jdk.java.net/11/"><span class="s5">OpenJDK</span></a>)
          installed and situated in your PATH such that it will be the
          first Java version found.</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">If not already available,
          download and install <a href="https://maven.apache.org"><span
              class="s5">Apache Maven</span></a> and have it placed in
          your PATH also</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Likewise, if not already
          installed, download and install <a href="https://git-scm.com"><span
              class="s5">git</span></a> and have it in your PATH too</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Download and install an early
          access version of OpenJDK that includes the <tt>jpackage</tt>
          utility.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can find a version <a
            href="https://jdk.java.net/jpackage/"><span class="s5">here</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;


          </span>Note, you currently must have both Java versions
          available.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot attempt to take the
          <tt>jpacakage</tt> utility from the EA version of OpenJDK 13
          and move it into JDK 11.<span>&nbsp; </span>It wonâ€™t work. </span></li>
    </ol>
    Assuming your environment is set up correctly, there's only a few
    steps needed to get to the point of creating an application image,
    via <tt>jpackage</tt>, for our sample application:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>git clone https://github.com/jtconnors/SocketClientFX.git</tt></li>
      <li><tt>cd SocketClientFX</tt></li>
      <li><tt>mvn package</tt></li>
      <li><tt>sh/link.sh -e </tt> (on MacOS) or <tt>powershell
          ps1\link.ps1 -e </tt>(on Windows) - this creates a runtime
        image via the <tt>jlink</tt> utility in the <tt>image/</tt>
        directory.</li>
    </ul>
    With this done you can run either version of the script below which
    invokes <tt>jpackage</tt> to create a native application installer:
    <ul>
      <li>MacOS: <tt>sh/create-appimage.sh -e</tt></li>
      <li>Windows: <tt>powershell ps1\create-appimage.ps1 -e</tt></li>
    </ul>
    Here's what a sample <tt>jpackage</tt> incantation on MacOS looks
    like:<br>
    <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      /Users/jtconnor/Downloads/jdk-13.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/jpackage
      create-image --runtime-image image --input target --output
      appimage --name SocketClientFX --main-jar SocketClientFX-11.0.jar</tt><br>
    <br>
    Lets take a look at each individual component of the command:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>/Users/jtconnor/Downloads/jdk-13.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/jpackage</tt>
        - The <tt>jpackage</tt> utility is not part of the latest (JDK
        11) distribution.&nbsp; Currently an early access version of
        Open JDK 13 is available which contains this utility.&nbsp; So
        we need this version of Open JDK just to run <tt>jpackage</tt>.&nbsp;


        Note: if attempting to recreate this demonstration, you may need
        to edit the <tt>sh/env.sh</tt> or <tt>ps1/env.ps1</tt> file
        and change the value of the <tt>JPACKAGE_HOME</tt>
        variable.&nbsp; It is, by default, set to reside under user's <tt>Downloads</tt>
        directory.</li>
      <li><tt>create-image</tt> - one of three different modes that must
        be supplied on the command-line (<tt>create-image</tt>, <tt>create-installer</tt>
        or <tt>create-jre-installer</tt>), <tt>create-image</tt>
        instructs <tt>jpackage</tt> to create a platform-specific
        application image for our program.</li>
      <li><tt>--runtime-image image</tt> - directory containing the <tt>jlink</tt>'ed


        runtime image created by the <tt>sh/link.sh</tt> script.</li>
      <li><tt>--input target</tt> - this points to the directory
        containing the modules(s) comprising this application.&nbsp; As
        this application is built by Apache maven, that directory is, by
        default, <tt>target/</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>--output appimage</tt> - this is the directory under which
        the generated application image will be placed.</li>
      <li><tt>--name SocketClientFX</tt> - this is what the application
        image will be named.</li>
      <li><tt>--main-jar SocketClientFX-11.0.jar</tt> - this is the main
        jar file containing the main class.&nbsp; It is located inside
        the directory specified by the <tt>--input</tt> option (in this
        case <tt>target/</tt>).</li>
    </ul>
    When complete, the single <tt>appimage/</tt> directory contains the
    platform-specifc application directory.&nbsp; In the video, the
    MacOS-genertated <tt>appimage/</tt> directory has a <tt>SocketClientFX.app</tt>
    icon which is in reality a directory with multiple
    subdirectories.&nbsp; To the MacOS finder application though, it
    looks like a properly formatted application and by simply dragging
    the <tt>SocketClientFX.app</tt> icon to the <tt>Applications</tt>
    folder, the <tt>SocketClientFX</tt> application is formally
    installed.<br>
    <br>
    For the final step, you can convert the application image into a
    proper platform-specific installer using the <tt>jpackage
      create-installer</tt> directive.&nbsp; The SocketClientFX project
    contains the following scripts which aid in the creation of
    installers:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>sh/create-dmg-installer.sh</tt> - creates a native MacOS
        dmg installer of this application using JEP-343 jpackage tool</li>
      <li><tt>ps1\create-exe-installer.ps1</tt> - creates a native
        Windows EXE installer of this application using JEP-343 jpackage
        tool</li>
      <li><tt>ps1\create-msi-installer.ps1</tt> - creates a native
        Windows MSI installer of this application using JEP-343 jpackage
        tool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As an example invocation on Windows, issuing</p>
    <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powershell ps1\create-exe-installer.ps1 -e</tt></p>
    <p>would have a <tt>jpackage</tt> command-line which looks
      something like this:<br>
      <br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~\Downloads\jdk-13\bin\jpackage.exe
        create-installer --installer-type exe --output "installer"
        --app-image "appimage/SocketClientFX" --name "SocketClientFX"</tt><br>
      <br>
      Please note, to create either an <tt>EXE</tt> or <tt>MSI</tt>
      installer on Windows does require third party applications (like,
      for example Inno or WiX toolkit respectively) to&nbsp; be
      installed and available on your command-line <tt>PATH</tt>.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      This article barely scratches the surface of the proposed <tt>jpackage</tt>
      tool.&nbsp; For example, there are literally dozens of additional
      command options to provide image and installation
      customizations.&nbsp; But it does at least provide one working
      example, which at this point is a bit of a rarity.&nbsp; Expect
      more information to become available the this technology matures.</p>
