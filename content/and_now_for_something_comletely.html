      departure from the&nbsp;standard fare.&nbsp; Today, I'd like to
      discuss my foray into the <u><a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/"

      world, and in particular, how contributing (in an infinitesimally
      small but meaningful way)&nbsp;strengthens the decentralized
      Bitcoin network.&nbsp; In short, I have become a Bitcoin
      miner.&nbsp; Before going any further, let me be perfectly clear:
      there is no gold in them thar' hills. Unless you plan
      on&nbsp;mining on an industrial scale where electricity is
      plentiful and more importantly, cheap, you will&nbsp;likely
      achieve&nbsp;a negative return on your investment.&nbsp; But it's
      still fun to do.<br>

    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
    <p>The revolutionary idea behind Bitcoin is the fact that&nbsp;its
      transactions are verified in a decentralized fashion free from
      manipulation by&nbsp;governments and banks.&nbsp; The more systems
      on the network that participate in the verification, the less
      likely any one entity has the ability to take a majority stake and
      threaten the ecosystem.&nbsp; To encourage participation,
      verifiers,&nbsp;otherwise known as
      miners,&nbsp;are&nbsp;periodically rewarded with Bitcoins.&nbsp;
      Bitcoin mining draws parallels to precious metal mining in that
      (1) the resource is scarce and finite (only 21 million will ever
      be issued) and (2) mining is labor intensive.</p>
    <p>Miners compete for winning Bitcoins that are periodically
      released by both verifying transactions and solving complicated
      mathematical hashing calculations.&nbsp; Obviously grossly
      oversimplified, you can begin&nbsp;to better understand the
      concept of mining <u><a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#mining"
          data-cke-saved-href="https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#mining">here</a></u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The






      organizations with the most computing power have the best odds at
      winning the&nbsp;Bitcoin lottery.&nbsp; You can, of course,
      attempt to go it alone and compete with the rest of the world in
      trying to win Bitcoins, but the odds of doing so are very, very
      slim.&nbsp; Instead nowadays it probably makes more sense&nbsp;to
      join one of a number of large mining pools that share resources
      and consequently share in the overall pool's success.&nbsp;
      In&nbsp;a pool you receive a payout commensurate with your
      percentage contribution to that pool.</p>

    <p>The image that follows, along with the subsequent description of
      the component parts,&nbsp;describes the&nbsp;rig.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Raspberry Pi 3</b>:&nbsp; The venerable <u><a
            href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"
            data-cke-saved-href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry
            Pi</a></u> serves as the overall controller for the Bitcoin
        mining rig and uses the <u><a

            data-cke-saved-href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CGMiner">cgminer</a></u>
        software to manage our mining devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pi has
        more than adequate&nbsp;compute power for this project and
        consumes a minimum amount of electricity.</li>
      <li><b>GekkoScience 2-Pac (BM1384x2) USB Bitcoin miners</b>: There
        was a time when hashing calculations were performed on
        CPUs,&nbsp;however&nbsp;it quickly became apparent that
        specialized hardware would perform these tasks far more
        efficiently.&nbsp; The first leap was to utilize a system's GPU
        (which is still&nbsp;an ideal way of mining other digital
        currencies).&nbsp; Nowadays for Bitcoin, any mining hardware
        worth using is based upon specialized ASICs (Application
        Specific Integrated Circuits)&nbsp;that are far more efficient
        than GPUs.&nbsp; The GekkoScience 2-Pac (BM1384x2) USB Bitcoin
        miners are state-of-the-art (September 2017) when it comes to
        the engineering&nbsp;trade off between performance and power
        efficiency.&nbsp; These devices can be run at different
        frequencies; the default (100MHz) yields a device which can
        perform about 15 billion hashes a second (usually written
        as&nbsp;15 Gh/s).&nbsp; By upping the clock frequency, you
        increase the hash rate and also&nbsp;consequently, power
        consumption.&nbsp; <i>These 4 devices are running at 225 MHz
          and combined, execute approximately 100Gh/s.&nbsp; The power
          consumption for this rig is approximately 50 Watts</i>.</li>
      <li><b>HooToo 60W 7-port powered USB hubs</b>: One of the
        challenges with setting up this rig was finding USB hubs that
        could power the 2-Pac USB mining devices, as each easily
        consumes 10 Watts or more.&nbsp; Powered USB hubs are an
        absolute necessity, and most powered hubs can only support the
        power requirements for one of these devices.&nbsp; The HooToo
        hub, rated at 60W, can support two devices at 225MHz (plus a USB
        fan).&nbsp; I was hoping to add at least one more miner to each
        USB hub, but that appears to be a bit unstable.&nbsp; Not being
        an electrical engineer, I don't understand why.</li>
      <li><b>Artic Breeze USB Fan</b>: The USB mining devices run hot,
        especially when overclocked.&nbsp; A fan is essential&nbsp;to
        keep things cool and extend the life of the mining devices.</li>

    <p>Once the requisite hardware is gathered, there are a few general
      steps required to get up and running:</p>

    </ul>
    <p><u><a href="resource/bitcoin/Bitcoin_Mining_Pi.txt">This text
          file</a></u> describes the steps needed to set up the rig
      described in this article.&nbsp; In terms of choosing a Bitcoin
      wallet and mining pool there are a multitude of choices.&nbsp; <u><a

    <p><b>Return on Investment?</b></p>
    <p>Is&nbsp;mining a money making enterprise?&nbsp; At this
      small&nbsp;scale, absolutely not.&nbsp; Ignoring the
      non-trivial&nbsp;upfront&nbsp;capital cost of the hardware
      required to run this rig, you're likely to spend more in
      electricity than you could accrue in Bitcoin.&nbsp; The price of
      Bitcoin is so volatile, and the amount of hashing power that
      contributes to the network changes (generally increasing over
      time) that any metrics provided here would only be relevant for
      one point in time.&nbsp; But what the heck.&nbsp; At the current
      time, based upon my contribution to the Slush Pool mining pool, my
      rig is rewarded approximately .000035 Bitcoins a day.&nbsp; As of
      the writing of this article, <u><a
          href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/"
          data-cke-saved-href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/">the
          current price of Bitcoin</a></u> is about $4300 US.&nbsp;
      Doing the arithmetic yields a reward of about $0.15 US&nbsp;a
      day.&nbsp; It costs more in electricity each day (especially in
      New York) to power a 50 Watt rig.</p>
