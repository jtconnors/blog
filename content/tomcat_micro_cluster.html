    <big><b>Tomcat Micro Cluster</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 3 January 2012</small></small><br>
    <p> The term <a
        href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/micro-server.html">Micro
        Server</a> has been bandied about recently as a means to provide
      a certain class of server functionality. As embedded systems
      continue their inexorable drive towards better performance, and
      standard hardware/software architectures become ubiquitous, the
      notion of using low-cost, low-power, small-footprint devices as
      servers becomes quite realistic.&nbsp; Just as data center
      managers have utilized multitudes of affordable rack mount servers
      to provide scalability, why not duplicate that effort with these
      off-the-shelf devices?</p>
    <p>The video that follows takes the Micro Server to its next logical
      evolution: <i>The Micro Cluster</i>.&nbsp; Built from commodity
      hardware (and by commodity I mean The Home Depot), the cluster
      board has a rack mount form factor that can house 12 <a
        href="http://www.plugcomputer.org/">Plug Computers</a>.&nbsp; As
      the <a

        SE HotSpot Virtual Machine</a><a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">
        is available for the Plug Computer (ArmV5/Linux)</a>, we'll
      utilize Apache Tomcat to demonstrate a <i>Tomcat Micro Cluster</i>.&nbsp;


      Over time, as the individual compute nodes increase in performance
      and capacity, this should become even more compelling.<br>
