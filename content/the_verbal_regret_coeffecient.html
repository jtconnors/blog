    <big><b>The Verbal Regret Coefficient</b></big><br>
    <small>By Jim Connors 16 Feb 2007 </small>
    <p>I am convinced that scientists will some day find an explanation
      for my continual verbal ineptitude.&nbsp; It will probably be
      identified as a sequence in our genome and they'll call it
      something like <i>The Verbal Regret Coefficient</i>.&nbsp; We are
      all born with it, and we can't escape how it influences us
      everyday.&nbsp; In advance of its discovery, I propose this
      definition: The Verbal Regret Coefficient is that innate ensemble
      of dispositions which guarantees that after uttering a number of
      words, you will regret having said a certain percentage of
      them.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>My first choice for a name was<i> Regret Coefficient</i>, but
      incredibly a quick search seems to indicate that the insurance
      industry already uses that term.&nbsp;&nbsp; If my theory catches
      on -- and you'll know that when someone dedicates a wikipedia
      entry -- I don't want to have to deal with copyright and trademark
      infringement.&nbsp; So Verbal Regret Coefficient it is.</p>
    <p>The Verbal Regret Coefficient or VRC will ultimately be
      quantified, and like a cholesterol count, we'll all be assigned a
      VRC value.&nbsp; Most will fall into an average range, but there
      will be outliers.&nbsp; A high VRC manifests itself behaviorally
      in many ways: some high VRC'ers are purposely controversial,
      outspoken, brash or arrogant.&nbsp; While others simply fail to
      think before they speak.&nbsp; In case you're wondering, I am one
      of those outliers with a dangerously high VRC.&nbsp; Furthermore,
      I'm quite sure I don't fit into the arrogant and controversial
      group.&nbsp; But it's not all good news for those with a low VRC.
      &nbsp; Although low VRC'ers tend not to say anything regrettable,
      they tend also not to say anything of substance either.&nbsp; We
      call these people politicians.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If the current social trend continues, we'll get away with
      blaming any verbal <i>faux pas</i> to our VRC.&nbsp; They'll be
      VRC support groups and celebrity VRC rehabilitation
      clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe we could avoid all this silliness
      and just heed the advice of Mark Twain who once said:</p>
    <blockquote><i><span class="body">It is better to keep your mouth
          closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and
          remove all doubt.</span></i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But that is sooooo hard. <br>
