    <big><b>Source Code for JavaFX Scoreboard Now Available</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 7 February 2013</small></small><br>
    <br>
    For the last few years, many of the JavaFX related blog posts found
    here have made reference to all or parts of a Scoreboard application
    written in JavaFX.&nbsp; For example, <a
      href="a_raspberry_pi_javafx_electronic.html">the entry prior to
      this</a> contains a video demonstrating how this Scoreboard
    application can be run on an embedded device such as a <a
      href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and displayed
    on an ordinary flat screen TV.
    <p>Alongside those posts, some have asked for access to the source
      code to this application.&nbsp; I've always felt uncomfortable
      releasing the code, not under the delusion that it has any
      commercial value, but rather because, let us say, it was not
      developed with the strictest software engineering standards in
      mind.&nbsp; Having gotten over those insecurities (not really),
      I've decided to place it in a <a href="https://home.java.net/">java.net</a>
      project called <a
        href="https://java.net/projects/javafx-scoreboard">javafx-scoreboard</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in gaining access to this code you'll need
      to do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Register on <a href="https://java.net/projects">https://home.java.net/projects</a>&nbsp;


        to get a java.net account.&nbsp; It's free and painless.&nbsp;
        If you already have an account, terrific! You can skip this
        step.</li>
      <li>Send an email to me at <a
          href="mailto:james.connors@oracle.com">james.connors@oracle.com</a>&nbsp;


        asking to be added to the <a
          href="https://java.net/projects/javafx-scoreboard">javafx-scoreboard</a>
        project.&nbsp; Include your java.net username in the email.</li>
      <li>Once you're added to the project, you'll have download access
        to the contents of the project.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For grins, here's document that gives an <a
        href="resource/javafx-scoreboard/README-v1.1.html">overview of
        the Scoreboard application</a>.</p>
    <p> Cheers.</p>
