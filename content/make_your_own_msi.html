      <p><b>Make Your Own MSI (and RPM, DEB &amp; DMG) with JDK14<br>
        </b><small>by Jim Connors 18 March 2020</small></p>
      <p>Throughout much of its long history, Java Runtime Environments
        for MS-Windows have traditionally been packaged up in the
        venerable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.exe"><tt>EXE</tt></a>
        format for installation.&nbsp; This made for a well understood,
        straightforward and standard way of installing Java for
        individual users, unfortunately at the expense of those tasked
        with managing Windows systems en masse.&nbsp; EXE files don't
        necessarily play well in the Windows systems administration
        world where tools like <a
href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft




          SCCM</a> and many other capable alternatives are used.&nbsp; A
        more preferable payload is the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer"><tt>MSI</tt></a>
        format.&nbsp; The equivalents in the Linux and MacOS world would
        be the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager"><tt>RPM</tt></a>/<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29"><tt>DEB</tt></a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Disk_Image"><tt>DMG</tt></a>
        formats respectively.</p>
      <p>To help rectify this shortcoming, some organizations have seen
        fit to produce their own MSI versions.&nbsp; Oracle for example
        provides an <a
href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/msiinstallerfaq-2967694.html">Enterprise




          MSI Installer</a> for its <a
          href="https://www.oracle.com/java/java-se-subscription.html">Java




          SE Subscription</a> customers with its Oracle JDK 7 and JDK 8
        releases.&nbsp; Among the litany of Open JDK distributions, a
        few have also decided to package up their own MSI versions too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/14/">JDK 14</a>
        marks the introduction of a formal <a
          href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11">incubator module</a>
        called <tt>jdk.incubator.jpackage</tt>, addressing the ability
        to package up Java applications in native format.&nbsp; The full
        extent of the tool is far beyond the scope of this article; one
        of the corner cases that the <a
          href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343"><tt>jpackage</tt></a>
        tool handles is the ability to simply create native installer
        (MSI, DEB, RPM, DMG) versions of a complete JDK.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
      <p>Let's cut to the chase and show examples on two of the three
        major platforms.&nbsp; For Windows, we'll use an Oracle JDK 14
        instance located in the <tt>D:\jdk-14</tt> directory.&nbsp; The
        following command will create a JDK 14 MSI file where the name
        and vendor has been specified via the <tt>-n</tt> and <tt>--vendor</tt>
        arguments:</p>
      <pre><code>D:\&gt;  jdk-14\bin\jpackage -n jdk-14-GA --type msi --vendor "Joe Schmo" --runtime-image jdk-14
</code></pre>
      <p>There are additional directives that can be furnished fo
        further customize the resulting package. Upon completion of the
        <tt>jpackage</tt> command, a file named <tt>jdk-14-GA-1.0.msi</tt>
        is created.&nbsp; Once installed it appears in the Windows
        registry as follows:</p>
      <img alt="" src="resource/JDK14/InstalledMSI.jpg" width="612"
        height="389">
      <p>In the Linux world, we'll use Oracle's OpenJDK 14 distribution.
        Two sample invocations follow, one to create a DEB package, the
        other to create an RPM:</p>
      <p><code>$ jdk-14/bin/jpackage -n openjdk-14-GA --type deb
          --vendor "Joe Debian" --runtime-image jdk-14</code></p>
      <p>produces a file named <tt>openjdk-14-ga_1.0-1_amd64.deb</tt></p>
      <p><code>$ jdk-14/bin/jpackage -n openjdk-14-GA --type rpm
          --vendor "Joe RedHat" --runtime-image jdk-14</code></p>
      <p>produces a file named <tt>openjdk-14-ga_1.0-1.x86_64.rpm</tt></p>
      <p>On a Ubuntu system, the&nbsp;<tt>openjdk-14-ga_1.0-1_amd64.deb</tt>&nbsp;




        file can be installed and verified as shown by the screenshot
        that follows:</p>

      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
      <p>Two points are worth mentioning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no notion of cross-building packages.&nbsp; That is
          to say you must run <tt>jpackage</tt> on the same platform
          you wish to create a package for.&nbsp; Create Windows
          packages on Windows systems,&nbsp; Linux packages on Linux
          systems and MacOS packages on MacOS systems.</li>
        <li>The Java Packaging Tool is in the incubator stage.&nbsp;
          Incubator modules put technology in the hands of developers
          prior to finalization.&nbsp; As such, expect further
          refinements to the <tt>jpackage</tt> API as community
          feedback is solicited.</li>
