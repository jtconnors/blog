          </big></small></small>A veteran Java ONE keynote presenter, <a
        href="http://www.perronerobotics.com/">Perrone Robotics</a> has
      developed some real interesting technologies which take the
      concept of using autonomous (i.e. unmanned) vehicles to a whole
      new level.&nbsp; One of their key ingredients is the MAX software
      platform which utilizes common commercially available components
      to enable Perrone to very quickly and cost-effectively retrofit
      nearly any vehicle in short order.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The MAX robotics platform runs on a (roughly 4" x 6") low-power
      PC board atop Solaris and <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/fullyconcurrentgarbagecollector-137267.html">Sun's



        Java Real-Time System (Java RTS)</a>.&nbsp; This combination
      gives Perrone the ability to leverage the huge Java development
      community, and assures that their critical software components
      behave in a predictable and deterministic fashion.</p>
    <p>During the Java ONE 2007 conference, I was speaking with Paul
      Perrone about the notion of creating a <a
        href="framework_to_help_create_small.html">minimized version of
        Solaris</a> over which his platform might run.&nbsp; The
      helicopter pictured above, boots from a relatively small
      (4-8Gb)&nbsp; IDE flash drive, where standard Solaris takes up a
      substantial chunk.&nbsp; It leaves them precious little space to
      collect valuable information like telemetry or terrain data.&nbsp;
      Paul asked to revist this idea for a future project.&nbsp; That's
      where we left off.</p>
    <p>Not that we've ignored them since, but it wasn't until a year
      later that small Solaris reared its head again.&nbsp; In addition
      to saving space, their main interest in this environment was in
      seeing <i>how much faster Solaris might boot up</i>.&nbsp; The
      ability to be fully functional from power-up in as short a time as
      possible is of critical importance.</p>
    <p>So before investigating what advantages there might be, let's
      provide some background information:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hardware<br>
      </b></p>
    <p>Two separate systems were used, and for argument's sake,
      represent two ends of the x86 compute spectrum.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Operating Systems</b></p>
    <p>Minimal configurations were created for Solaris 10 08/07 (Update
      4) and OpenSolaris Nevada build 93.&nbsp; These configurations
      boot entirely into RAM and consume less than 100MB ramdisk
      space.&nbsp; With a little more effort they can be may
      significantly smaller.&nbsp; The original blog post describing the
      environment is <a href="framework_to_help_create_small.html">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;



      You can download the framework for these hardware/OS combinations
      <a href="resource/fast_boot_solaris/min_sol_framework.tar">here</a>,
      and can get a feel for the build environment by taking a look at
      this <a href="resource/fast_boot_solaris/README.txt">README</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><b>Definitions</b></p>
    <p>Within the context of this discussion, here are the key terms
      along with their meanings.<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><i>Total Boot Time</i></b>: This is the time it takes from
        power-up till a user is prompted to log in.&nbsp; Typically for
        a full Solaris installation, the windowing system must first
        start up and present the user with a login screen.&nbsp; In a
        minimal Solaris environment, there is no windowing system.&nbsp;
        Instead, the <i>total boot time</i> is defined as the time it
        takes from power-up till a user is prompted with the <font
          face="courier new,courier,monospace">console login:</font>
        prompt.</p>
      <p><i><b>POST Time</b></i>: POST or <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test">Power
          On Self Test</a> is the time taken by the system at pre-boot
        to handle things like diagnostics,&nbsp; BIOS and device
        initialization.&nbsp; For this discussion, we'll define <i>POST
          time</i> as the time it takes from power-up until the user is
        presented with a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a>
        boot menu.&nbsp; We call out this segment of the total time
        because in many cases we are at the mercy of the PC/BIOS
        manufacturer and can't overly influence how quickly or slowly
        this proceeds.</p>
      <p><i><b>Solaris Boot Time</b></i>: The time it takes from being
        presented with a GRUB boot menu till a Solaris user is prompted
        to log in.&nbsp; Again, depending upon whether a windowing
        system is configured or not, this may represent the time it
        takes to be prompted with a login screen or <font face="courier
          new,courier,monospace">console login:</font> prompt
        respectively.&nbsp; This represents the segment of time that we
        can influence.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We can conclude from these definitions that: </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Boot Time</i> = <i>POST Time</i> + <i>Solaris



          Boot Time</i></p>

    <p><b>Conclusions/Notes</b></p>
    <p>1. These times were taken by hand with the stopwatch feature on
      my Timex.&nbsp; If anything, the times might be slightly shorter
      than actually recorded as there is a human delay in reacting to
      seeing the necessary prompts.&nbsp; I ran the tests several times,
      and the same numbers consistently appear.<br>
    </p>
    <p>2. The version of the OS appears to matter a lot, as OpenSolaris
      nvx_93 boots up nearly twice as fast as Solaris 10 U4 on the same
      hardware.</p>
    <p>3. The type of I/O device subsystem seems to be a big factor
      too.&nbsp; For example, by switching out the IDE Flash Drive with
      a 5400 RPM IDE hard disk, i84810 total boot time decreased by
      about 6 seconds for both Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>4. The minimal Solaris environment is currently only available in
      32-bit mode.<br>
    </p>
    <p>5. With relative ease, Solaris can be configured to boot in less
      that 10 seconds on modern x86 hardware.&nbsp; My unofficial record
      stands at 9 seconds (or slightly less).&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt it
      could boot faster on more robust hardware (eliminating POST
      time).&nbsp; Any takers?<br>
