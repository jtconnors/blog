    <b><big>Java Serial Communications Revisited</big></b><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 20 June 2014</small></small><br>
    <br>
    Last touched upon in <a
      href="serial_port_communication_for_java.html">this article</a>
    dated August 2011, it's high time to revisit the state of Java
    serial port communications options for the following reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>As the hype around Internet of Things continues to ratchet up,
        serial communications are a requirement for a certain class of
        IoT sensors and devices.</li>
      <li>RxTx, the platform with arguably the most history, cannot be
        built with the recently released Java 8 JDK without some
        modifications.</li>
      <li>For some time now the website hosting the RxTx project: <a
          href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a>
        has not been available.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Building support for additional specifications like RS-485 and
        parallel is available in RxTx but was never addressed in the
        previous serial communications article.<br>
      </li>
      <li>An alternative framework called <a
          href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/">jSSC</a>
        is gaining in popularity and is worth further discussion.</li>
      <li>Work in the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/dio/">OpenJDK


          Device I/O Project</a> is progressing. Among the goals of this
        project is support for serial communications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>RxTx</b></p>
    <p>In my customer experiences, RxTx, despite its age, still gets
      mentioned most when considering serial communications with
      Java.&nbsp; For whatever reasons, the RxTx project has gone off
      line, and access to the project source code is not readily
      available.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have a copy, and have made a few
      enhancements such that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The source can now be compiled with a JDK versions 6, 7 and 8.</li>
      <li>The <a href="serial_port_communication_for_java.html">original


          article</a> discussed only enough modifications to build
        the&nbsp; <tt>librxtxSerial.so</tt> shared object required for
        traditional serial communications.&nbsp; The <tt>librxtxParallel.so</tt>,
        <tt>librxtxRaw.so</tt>, <tt>librxtxI2C.so</tt> and <tt>librxtxRS485.so</tt>
        shared objects could not be built.&nbsp; With some very slight
        modifications, these can successfully be built too.&nbsp; I make
        absolutely no promises as to their usefulness, but they do
        compile. :)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The source code is based upon the original 2.1-7r2 version and in
      this instance is now called <b><tt>2.1.7r2-Java8</tt></b>.&nbsp;
      You can download the source <a
        href="resource/rxtx-2.1-7r2-Java8/rxtx-2.1-7r2-Java8.tar.gz">here</a>.&nbsp;


      If you want to get a feel for the changes made, take a look at
      this file:&nbsp; <a
        href="resource/rxtx-2.1-7r2-Java8/JAVA8_MODS.txt"><b><tt>JAVA8_MODS.txt</tt></b></a>
      which can be found in the main directory of the source code.&nbsp;
      To build RxTx on your native platform:</p>
    <pre>   $ tar xvf 2.1.7r2-Java8.tar.gz
   $ cd 2.1.7r2-Java8/
   $ ./configure
   $ make
</pre>
    <p><b>jSSC </b></p>
    <p>The Java Simple Serial Connector, or jSSC for short, is another
      open source project that can be found here: <a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/">http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/</a>.&nbsp;



      It is available for a host of processor/OS combinations and, in
      addition to source availability, comes bundled in binary form
      too.&nbsp; Here's a list of supported platforms for its current
      2.6.0 release:<br>

    <p>Like RxTx, it contains a native component but is packaged in a
      nice transparent fashion.&nbsp; The one potential challenge here
      may be in trying to figure out how to support a new platform that
      isn't on this list.&nbsp; I didn't have a whole lot of success
      finding out how to build the binary, and admittedly didn't spend
      an inordinate amount of time trying to figure it out either.&nbsp;
      Nonetheless, this project is gaining in popularity and has a
      dedicated individual supporting the software.</p>
    <p><b>OpenJDK Device I/O</b></p>
    <p>Finally, a project is underway to treat serial communication and
      device I/O in general as a first class citizen for the Java SE
      standard. The wiki can be found here: <a
        href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/dio/Main">https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/dio/Main</a>.
      It is based on the work done to provide device I/O to the Java ME
      8 platform.&nbsp; Further solidifying the universality theme of
      Java 8, the ultimate goal would be to have a consistent device I/O
      API across both Java SE and Java ME.&nbsp; If you want to further
      understand what those APIs look like you can view them here: <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javame/8.0/api/dio/api/index.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javame/8.0/api/dio/api/index.html</a>.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, support for serial communications in Java SE is --
      albeit slowly -- progressing.&nbsp; There are multiple open source
      projects and commercial alternatives too.&nbsp; Ideally, it will
      be great to see a formal API supported by the Java SE Standard.<br>
