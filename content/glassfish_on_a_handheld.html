    <big><b>GlassFish on a Handheld</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 31 Dec 2009</small></small><br>
    <p>Until now, the idea of running something akin to a Java EE
      application server on a small handeld device would have been
      greeted with ridicule.&nbsp; Suddenly that notion doesn't seem so
      ridiculous when considering the recent technology that's been made
      available. In particular, the following software advances make
      this pipe dream more of a reality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/embedded-se/overview/index.html">Java


          Standard Edition for Embedded Devices</a>: A series of Java
        virtual machines are available from Sun for many of the popular
        embedded hardware/OS platforms. They are not only Java SE
        compatible, but have been space optimized from a static
        footprint and RAM perspective to perform in embedded
        environments.&nbsp; To give you an idea of some of those
        optimizations, read <a
          href="https://dzone.com/articles/reduced-footprint-java-se-brin">this</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li><a
href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/JavaEE/JavaEE6Overview.html">Java


          Enterprise Edition 6 Platform Specification and the Web
          Profile</a>:&nbsp; The Java EE 6 specification allows for the
        creation of a subset of the component technologies, called
        "profiles".&nbsp; The first of these has been dubbed the Web
        Profile and contains the common technologies required to create
        small to medium web applications.&nbsp; Rather than having to
        use a full blown Java EE application server in all its glory,
        you can take advantage of a significantly smaller, less complex
        framework.<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://embedded-glassfish.java.net/">Embedded
          GlassFish</a>: This capability, which is now part of GlassFish
        v3, enables you to run GlassFish inside your Java application,
        as opposed to the other way around. Simply put, there is no need
        install GlassFish or create GlassFish domains in this
        scenario.&nbsp; Instead, you include an instance of
        glassfish-embedded-web.jar in your classpath, make a few
        GlassFish Embedded API calls from your standard Java
        application, and voila! you've got a web application up and
        running.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Hardware</h4>
    <p>Rather than opting for one of the many embedded development
      platforms around (because I'm cheap), I instead decided to
      investigate what was available from a handheld perspective and see
      if that environment could be adapted to suit my needs.&nbsp; After
      some searching, it looked like the Nokia N810 just might fit the
      bill.&nbsp; Courtesy of my buddy Eric Bruno, here's a picture of
      the N810:<br>

      height="300">
    <p>To get a feel for this very capable device, check out <a
        href="http://www.ddj.com/java/208801979">Eric's Article</a>.
      What most interested me was that (1) it has 128MB RAM, (2)&nbsp; a
      400MHz Arm v6 processor, (3) runs a common embedded version of
      Linux (<a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo</a>), (4) has a version
      of Java SE Embedded (from Sun) which runs fine on this platform
      and (5) can be had for a relatively affordable price on eBay.</p>
    <h4>The Operating System</h4>
    <p>The Nokia N810 is powered by the <a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo</a>
      distribution, an open source platform with a thriving community of
      developers.&nbsp; Knowing full well that any attempt to get a web
      application up and running on this device would stretch its
      resources to the limit, it was necessary to reclaim as much RAM as
      possible before starting out.&nbsp; Here's a description of some
      of the kludgery involved:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>You'll need to download and install some additional
        applications which can be retrieved from the N810's Application
        Manager program.&nbsp; They include: <font face="courier
          new,courier,monospace">rootsh</font> to enable root access to
        the device and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">openssh-client</font>
        and <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">openssh-server</font>
        to remotely access the device.<br>
      </li>
      <li>A quick and dirty way to reclaim RAM is to shut down the
        X-server and kill all of the windowing applications that run in
        parallel. There are certainly more elegant ways to do this, but
        in addition to being cheap, I'm lazy too.&nbsp; What you quickly
        find out is that any attempt to manually kill off some of these
        processes results in a reboot of the tablet.&nbsp; Why? Because
        by default, the N810 includes a watchdog process that monitors
        the state of the system.&nbsp; If it detects any irregularities,
        it forces a restart.</li>
      <li>You can get around this problem by putting the device into
        what is called "R&amp;D" mode.&nbsp; This is achieved by
        downloading the "flasher" utility from maemo.org and
        establishing a USB connection between the N810 and your host
        computer.&nbsp; Directions for this process can be found <a
          href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Updating_the_tablet_firmware">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Once established, you can invoke the following flasher
        command:&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">flasher3.5


          --set-rd-flags=no-lifeguard-reset. </font>If this was done
        successfully, you'll notice that a wrench appears on the tablet
        screen when it is rebooted.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Once in R&amp;D mode you'll have to remotely ssh into the
        device via the WiFi connection. The following script called <a
          href="resource/embedded-glassfish/set-headless.sh"><font
            face="courier new,courier,monospace">set-headless.sh</font></a>
        has been provided to kill off the windowing system.&nbsp; After
        executing this script, the N810 in effect becomes a headless
        device.&nbsp; The only way to communicate with it is through the
        network.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>The Environment</h4>
    <p>Here's what was required to get the web application up and
      running:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ssh into the device.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Download an <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/java-se-embedded-archive-1862184.html">evaluation


          copy of Java SE Embedded</a> (ARMv6 Linux - Headless).&nbsp;
        For this example the download file was gunzip'ed and untar'ed
        into the N810 device's /usr directory resulting in a new
        /usr/ejre1.6.0_10 directory.</li>
      <li>Download a copy of <a
          href="resource/embedded-glassfish/glassfish-embedded-web-3.0.jar">glassfish-embedded-web-3.0.jar</a>
        and place this file in the /usr/ejre1.6.0_10/lib directory.</li>
      <li>Modify your PATH variable to include /usr/ejre1.6.0_10/bin and
        set your JAVA_HOME variable to /usr/ejre1.6.0_10</li>
      <li>Create a temporary directory, for this example we'll create a
        /root/tmp directory.</li>
      <li>Compile the following Java source file, <a
          href="resource/embedded-glassfish/Embedded.java">Embedded.java</a>,&nbsp;


        on a JDK equipped system, which is a slightly hacked version of
        the original provided by <a
          href="https://blogs.oracle.com/alexismp">Alexis
          Moussine-Pouchkine</a>.</li>
      <li>Create a glassfish directory under /root/tmp/ and place the
        compiled Embedded.class file there</li>
      <li>Download the sample hello web application, <a
          href="resource/embedded-glassfish/hello.war">hello.war</a>,
        and place it in the /root/tmp directory.<a
          href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/quickstart/hello.war"><br>
        </a></li>
      <li>Reclaim as much RAM as possible by running the <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/resource/embedded-glassfish/set-headless.sh">set-headless.sh</a>
        script<br>
      </li>
      <li>Run the web application from inside the /root/tmp directory
        via the the following command-line invocation: <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <pre>     # java -cp /usr/ejre1.6.0_10/lib/glassfish-embedded-web-3.0.jar:. glassfish/Embedded hello.war 600
</pre>
    <p>As the N810 cannot match even the most modest of laptops in terms
      of performance, be prepared to wait around a little before the
      application is ready.&nbsp; Check this <a
        href="resource/embedded-glassfish/log.txt">output</a> to see
      what is printed out to the console during invocation.</p>
    <p>For this run the, N810 was assigned a WiFi IP address of
      192.168.1.102, thus the browser is pointed to that address with
      port 8888.&nbsp; Here's what comes up:</p>
    <img alt="" src="resource/embedded-glassfish/N810hello1.jpg"
      width="680" height="504">
    <p>And Interacting with the web app produces this:</p>
    <img alt="" src="resource/embedded-glassfish/N810hello2.jpg"
      width="680" height="504">
    <p> </p>
    <p>So this is obviously not ready for prime time, but it does open
      up a whole lot more possibilities in the near future.</p>
    <p>Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p>
