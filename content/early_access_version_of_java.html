    <p><big><b>Early Access version of Java RTS 2.2 Released</b></big><br>
      <small>By Jim Connors 10 June 2009</small><br>
    </p>
    <p>Just in time for the start of JavaOne 2009, Sun released the
      latest version of its real-time Java platform, Java RTS 2.2, in
      early access form.&nbsp; New features of this release include but
      are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OS Platform support for Solaris 10 (x86 and Sparc - Update 5
        &amp; 6), Red Hat MRG 1.1 and&nbsp; SUSE Linux Enterprise
        Real-Time 10 (SP2 Update 4)</li>
      <li>64-bit support for the three operating systems mentioned
        above. In addition, 32-bit support continues to be supported.</li>
      <li>Faster throughput. Java RTS 2.2 utilizes a new dynamic (JIT)
        compiler targeted for Java SE 7 which contains several
        performance improvements including a new register allocator.</li>
      <li>TSV (Thread Scheduling Visualizer) enhancements.<br>
      </li>
      <li>NetBeans plug-in support for Java RTS and TSV.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>New Initialization-Time-Compilation (ITC) options including
        the ability to wild card a set of methods vs listing single
        methods and support for specifying compilation based on thread
        type.</li>
      <li>Auto-tuning and startup improvements made to the Real-time
        Garbage Collector (RTGC).</li>
      <li>New documentation including a <i>Java RTS Quick Start Guide</i>
        to get new users started quickly with minimum programming and
        configuration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> A 90-day evaluation is available here:<a
