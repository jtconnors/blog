    If you're reading this article, the chances are real good that your
    home is full of electronic gadgets.&nbsp; Moreover many are
    permanently plugged into wall sockets. &nbsp; Having recently
    purchased a <a
      href="http://www.p3international.com/products/p4460.html">P3
      International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ</a> power meter, I've been
    running around getting a feel for how much energy some of these
    common components use.<br>
    <br>

    <p> </p>
    <p>For this first table, I wanted to see how much energy was being
      consumed by audio/visual components that were <em>plugged into
        the wall, but not powered on.</em>&nbsp; Indeed some of these
      numbers are eye-opening:</p>

    <p>The granularity of the P4460 is hundredths of kilowatt-hours,
      which means that in order to get a decent reading on a low-power
      device, you've got to leave it attached for a while.&nbsp; No
      doubt some of these measurements could be more accurate, but I
      think you get the point.&nbsp; Of note:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The 4 components that comprise the audio system consume over
        22 watts all day, every day 24x7.</li>
      <li>As set top boxes gain more functionality (e.g. DVR), they suck
        up even more power.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this rate, you'd think the
        power utility would subsidize the cable companies to get as many
        of these things installed as possible.</li>
      <li>All told, the devices in the preceding table consume an amount
        of energy similar to a 75 watt incandescent light bulb being
        left on all the time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the most part, these components are non-critical, and one
      could argue that some (e.g&nbsp; the stereo) should be connected
      to a power strip with an on/off button. This should not pose much
      of an inconvenience.&nbsp; However, it's a completely different
      story when it comes to the video components.&nbsp; When powered
      cycled, set top boxes take forever to reach full functionality as
      they reboot over the cable network.&nbsp; And televisions, if left
      untethered to electric power for too long, go through this whole
      channel search sequence when they're powered up.&nbsp; In short,
      when it comes to video, you're currently stuck with paying the
      hidden price of "convenience".</p>
    <p>For the computer nerd in us, here's a table comprising some of
      the computer/network-related components that are left on 24x7.</p>

    <p>A decade ago, devices like those listed above were virtually
      non-existent in the home.&nbsp; So what's the cost of being
      Internet ready anytime, anywhere?&nbsp; About 40 watts all day and
      all night. Some final points:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In general, carefully consider keeping around older
        gadgets.&nbsp; The circa 1990s devices definitely use more
        energy than their newer, more functional counterparts.</li>
      <li>Notice no computers are included.&nbsp; You know you have more
        than one, some (present company included) have way more than
        one.&nbsp; Let's hope you're turning these off or at least
        putting them to sleep at night!<br>
      </li>
