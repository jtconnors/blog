    <p>Jim Clarke, Eric Bruno and I have been selected to present this
      year at <a title="Java ONE"
        href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">Java ONE</a>.&nbsp;


      The title of our session is called "TS-1205 The Sun Java Real-Time
      System Meets Wall Street".&nbsp; We're scheduled to present on
      Wednesday, May 9 at 10:55AM - 11:55AM Pacific in the Moscone
      Convention Center in San Francisco.&nbsp; If you plan on
      attending, please stop by and see us.&nbsp; For those that can't
      make the event, we'll be sure to post the slides once we're
      permitted.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To get an idea of what we'll discuss, take a look at the abstract
      below;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;ABSTRACT</p>
    <p><i>Today's financial institutions use program trading systems to
        automatically execute split-second trades based on sophisticated
        algorithms that assess current market conditions. Trade
        decisions and execution must occur in a timely fashion to
        capitalize on the market. Missing a trade opportunity, even by a
        few seconds, can lead to significant losses.<br>
        <br>
        With improvements in Java technology performance, firms are
        starting to use Java technology to implement these algorithms
        and thereby realizing productivity gains over more-traditional
        C/C++ development. However, in these time-critical systems,
        there is still no guarantee that at any instant, the process
        will not be interrupted by the Java platform garbage collector.
        Although trade execution occurs most of the time within an
        acceptable response time, the trade execution is delayed every
        once in a while, due to garbage collection or some other system
        event.<br>
        <br>
        Sun's implementation of the Real-Time Specification for Java
        (JSR 001), the Sun Java Real-Time System, enables real-time
        processing through techniques that protect important threads
        from garbage collection and other system interrupts. This means
        that trading systems can confidently monitor the market and take
        action consistently within a calculated window of opportunity.<br>
        <br>
        To demonstrate the impact of these techniques, Sun's OEM
        Software Systems Engineering technical team has written a
        demonstration of a trading system that uses real trade data. The
        demonstration compares a regular Java virtual machine against
        the Sun Java Real-Time System. For each run, a graph shows the
        difference in the actual trade price and the price when the
        trade should have executed. Running this trading system with the
        Sun Java Real-Time System shows that no money is lost due to
        garbage collection latencies. The results will be contrasted
        with the same application run with the standard (non-real-time)
        Java virtual machine.<br>
        <br>
        This presentation demonstrates a working system and proves
        real-time Java technology's ability to satisfy hard real-time
        trading requirements.</i><br>
