    <big><b>Update to JavaFX, Sockets and Threading: Lessons Learned</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 9 April 2015</small></small><br>
    <br>
    Recently, a reader commented on a dated article of mine, circa 2010,
    entitled <a href="javafx_sockets_and_threading_lessons.html">JavaFX,








      Sockets and Threading: Lessons Learned</a>.&nbsp; In it he
    correctly stated that, as the original content is based on the
    deprecated JavaFX 1.3 framework (aka JavaFX Script), he cannot test
    or utilize that code with the modern JavaFX API.&nbsp; What follows
    is an update to that blog entry with code and references appropriate
    for the <a
      href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm">JavaFX 8
      (Java SE 8 with JavaFX) platform</a>.
    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
    <p>For a more thorough understanding of the method behind this
      madness, please consult the <a
        href="javafx_sockets_and_threading_lessons.html">original
        article</a>.&nbsp; Briefly stated, socket programming,
      especially in Java, often times lends itself to utilizing
      threads.&nbsp; To facilitate using sockets, both from the "client"
      and "server" side, an abstract class called <a
        href="resource/socket_FX8/GenericSocket.java">GenericSocket.java</a>
      was and is provided and, baring a few minor changes, remains quite
      similar to the original version. Just as in the Original JavaFX
      Script framework, <i><b>The JavaFX UI is still not thread-safe
          and its scene graph must only be accessed through the JavaFX
          application thread</b></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; What has changed
      between old and new is the class and method name required to
      perform work on the JavaFX application thread.</p>
    <p>Just like before, we've identified two methods associated with
      socket manipulations that need to perform work on the main
      thread.&nbsp; These abstract method calls are incorporated into
      the GenericSocket.java source and are specified in the <a
        href="resource/socket_FX8/SocketListener.java">SocketListener.java</a>
      interface file:</p>
    <pre>    public interface SocketListener {
        public void onMessage(String line);
        public void onClosedStatus(boolean isClosed);
    }</pre>
    <p>Within <a href="resource/socket_FX8/GenericSocket.java">GenericSocket.java</a>,
      you'll see references to these method calls as follows:</p>
    <pre>    /*
     * The onClosedStatus() method has to be implemented by
     * a sublclass.  If used in conjunction with JavaFX,
     * use Platform.runLater() to force this method to run
     * on the main thread.
     */
     onClosedStatus(true);</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;and</p>
    <pre>    /*
     * The onMessage() method has to be implemented by
     * a sublclass.  If used in conjunction with JavaFX,
     * use Platform.runLater() to force this method to run
     * on the main thread.
     */
     onMessage(line);</pre>
    <p>As implied by these comments, JavaFX-specifc classes that extend
      the <tt>GenericSocket</tt> class and implement the <tt>SocketListener</tt>
      interface are required.&nbsp; Correspondingly two helper classes
      have been created: <a
        href="resource/socket_FX8/FxSocketClient.java">FxSocketClient.java</a>
      and <a href="resource/socket_FX8/FxSocketServer.java">FxSocketServer.java</a>.&nbsp;








      These extend the <tt>GenericSocket</tt> class and implement the <tt>SocketListener</tt>
      interface from the perspective of a JavaFX environment.&nbsp; Both
      classes override the <tt>onMessage()</tt> method like this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <img alt="" src="resource/socket_FX8/onMessage.jpg" width="568"
      height="290">
    <p>Likewise, the <tt>onClosedStatus()</tt> method is implemented as
      follows:</p>
    <img alt="" src="resource/socket_FX8/onClosedStatus.png" width="569"
      height="289">
    <p> </p>
    <p>As these two code snippets exhibit, we enclose our execution
      requirements within a call to the <a
href="https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/application/Platform.html#runLater%28java.lang.Runnable%29"><tt>Platform.runLater()</tt></a>
      method, ensuring that&nbsp; it will be executed on the JavaFX
      application thread.&nbsp; (For the Java 8 aficionados, you may
      notice that these two methods could be converted to lambda
      expressions. That exercise is left to the reader.)&nbsp; What
      remains now is for any referencing JavaFX class to implement the <tt>SocketListener</tt>
      interface.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To demonstrate the usage of <tt>FxSocketClient</tt> and <tt>FxSocketServer</tt>
      classes within JavaFX 8, this article provides two NetBeans
      projects represented by the screenshots that follow.&nbsp; By
      clicking on each image, you can start up the <tt>FxSocketClient</tt>
      and <tt>FxSocketServer</tt> applications via <a
href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Java



        WebStart</a> (assuming you have (1) the latest Java 8 installed
      and (2) you have a browser which allows Java applets to run.&nbsp;
      The last browsers standing are Internet Explorer 11 and Safari).</p>

    <p>The user interface for these programs was created with the
      assistance of a terrific tool called the <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-info-2157684.html">JavaFX








        Scene Builder</a>.&nbsp; You can download the source code,
      including the UI (represented in FXML), here:</p>

    </ul>
    <p><b>The <tt>javafx.concurrent</tt> Package</b></p>
    <p>The intent of this article was to focus solely on the <tt>Platform.runLater()</tt>
      method, however, it is important to note that JavaFX 2.x also
      provides an additional means to create background tasks that
      safely interact with the JavaFX application thread.&nbsp; Similar
      in capability to the venerable <a
href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html"><tt>java.util.concurrent</tt></a>&nbsp;








      package (and in fact extending some of those classes), the <a
href="https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/concurrent/package-summary.html"><tt>javafx.concurrent</tt></a>
      package also furnishes the ability to safely control the execution
      and track the progress of the application code running in
      background tasks. For an overview of their use, check out the
      following article published as part of the Oracle documentation: <a
