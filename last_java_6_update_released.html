    <p><b>Last Java 6 Update Released</b><br>
      <small><small>by Jim Connors - 16 October 2018</small></small><br>
    </p>
    <p>After a storied career, with the release of this latest update (<a

        6 update 211</a>) , Java 6 has reached the end of its product
      lifetime.&nbsp; Introduced in December 2006, it represents the
      last vestiges of <a

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun
        Microsystems'</a> influence on the Java Platform and the
      transition Java release that spanned the acquisition of Sun by
      Oracle.&nbsp; To Oracle's credit, it was publicly updated -- that
      is to say freely updated and supported -- for six and a half
      years! When the next planned Java quarterly update arrives in
      January 2019 (sans Java 6), it will have surpassed 12 years of
      public and private support.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Our informal surveys indicate that Java 6 may still be used on as
      much as 10% of some customer's applications.&nbsp; That statement
      could be construed as both complimentary and concerning at the
      same time. From a complimentary perspective, it's is a credit to
      the longevity and stability of the Java platform and in particular
      Java 6.&nbsp; It is however concerning that if customers are using
      versions of Java 6 that haven't been updated for a long time, they
      could be susceptible to literally hundreds of well-known security
      vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Java is no different (no better, no worse)
      than any other large and complex software platform.&nbsp; Security
      vulnerabilities will be uncovered.&nbsp; Go ask the Windows and
      Linux crowd, for example.&nbsp; And just like with those, guys,
      when bugs are found they're fixed.</p>
    <p>These long release cycles for Java are a thing of the past.&nbsp;
      In order to drive innovation and enable Java to better compete in
      the modern application development landscape, the Java community
      has shifted to a calendar-based six month release model.&nbsp; For
      more on that, check out the following <a
