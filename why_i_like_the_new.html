              <p class="MsoNormal">I have a vested interest in seeing
                the original JavaFX Script based platform prosper. <span>
                </span>As an early adopter of this technology, a good
                portion of my life these past few years has been spent
                developing, blogging and even co-authoring a book on the
                subject.<span> </span>So when the inevitable demise of
                JavaFX Script was formally announced, those of us
                intimately involved did not take it lightly.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span></span>Perhaps not unlike
                yourselves, I’ve viewed the plans to morph JavaFX into a
                Java API with a bit of skepticism. <span> </span>The
                new resulting coding paradigm is unquestionably less
                stylish than its predecessor and can be downright
                verbose. <span> </span>But the new way grows on you. <span>
                </span>Having the privilege to experiment with early
                versions, I’ve come to like the new platform.<span> </span>In


                fact I like it a lot.<span> </span>Here’s why I think
                the new JavaFX platform is more attractive:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The community has spoken and it
                  doesn’t feel the need for yet another scripting
                  language.</b><span> </span>The attempt to lure
                graphics designers into the Java camp by offering a
                simplified Rich Internet Application environment never
                really panned out.<span> </span>Why? <span> </span>First,


                there already exists a wealth of mature, established RIA
                scripting alternatives.<span> </span>These address much
                of what designers need and JavaFX Script is not
                sufficiently different enough.<span> </span>Second, the
                clamor to provide RIA capabilities in Java comes from
                the Java community proper, not the graphics artists. <span>
                </span><span> </span>These developers have a lot
                invested in Java and are not interested in learning a
                new language.<span> </span>What they want is a Java API
                with RIA capabilities.<span> </span>By making JavaFX a
                first class citizen of the Java platform, it goes a long
                way towards meeting these desires.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The JavaFX API is a more universal
                  solution.</b><span> </span>By building an API in
                Java, the opportunity for developers of other dynamic
                languages (like JRuby and JavaScript) to access JavaFX
                has been made much easier.<span> </span>Moreover, as
                the trend to host other languages atop the Java Virtual
                Machine accelerates, these too will profit from this
                move.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><b>No more mapping between JavaFX
                  Script and Java</b>.<span> </span>A derivative of
                Java, one of the touted advantages of JavaFX Script is
                its ability to seamlessly integrate and leverage the
                wealth of Java code written already.<span> </span>Indeed

                a very important benefit, Java/JavaFX Script integration
                is mostly straightforward; however there are subtle
                differences between both languages that the developer
                must take into consideration.<span> </span>Mapping
                primitive Java data types to JavaFX basic types can be
                an issue.<span> </span>The original JavaFX classes can
                only extend Java classes that contain a default (no
                arguments) constructor.<span> </span>Features familiar
                to Java programmers, like multidimensional arrays,
                generics, annotations, and multi-threading have no real
                equivalent in JavaFX Script.<span> </span>Bringing the
                JavaFX class libraries directly onto the Java platform
                eliminates all of these concerns. <span> </span>If you
                want to use some external Java code, just use it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Superior Development Environment</b>.<span>
                </span>Attempting to debug JavaFX Script within an
                Integrated Development Environment is at best a tricky
                endeavor and at worst a waste of time. <span> </span>Additionally
only


                NetBeans, and to a lesser extent Eclipse, are the only
                viable JavaFX Script capable IDEs.<span> </span>As the
                new JavaFX platform is entirely based on Java, not only
                is debugging support first rate, the option of choosing
                other Java IDEs opens up considerably.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The new JavaFX results in, for
                  lack of a better term, more predictability</b>. <span>
                </span>One of the primary JavaFX Script mechanisms used
                to define and place graphical assets (Nodes) into the
                scenegraph is the object literal notation.<span> </span>Being


                static in nature, the notion of a sequential flow of
                events inside an object literal may not make much sense.<span>
                </span>To compensate, JavaFX Script introduces the
                powerful concept of binding.<span> </span>Without
                question, binding is very elegant, but it comes with a
                price.<span> </span>It is not uncommon to see liberal
                and arguably unnecessary use of binding throughout
                JavaFX script code.<span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">One can argue that bringing JavaFX to
                Java should lessen, but certainly not eliminate, the
                need for binding.<span> </span>Rather than defining
                objects inside a static initializer, JavaFX API objects
                are created and defined sequentially by constructor and
                method calls respectively.<span> </span>By defining
                objects in an order that makes sense, there is potential
                to eliminate a certain class of dependencies that were
                previously resolved with binding. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Improved performance.</b><span> </span>Although


                by default the JavaFX compiler generates Java bytes
                codes from JavaFX Script source, there is a command-line
                option which can be invoked to save the intermediate
                Java code that is produced as part of the process.<span>
                </span>A brief perusal of this source shows that even
                the most humble of JavaFX Script constructs churns out a
                lot of complicated Java code.<span> </span>Eliminating
                this overhead is bound to improve performance in many
                instances.<span> </span>Furthermore, significant
                optimizations to memory and static footprint as well as
                startup time are underway.<span> </span>Finally a new
                lightweight, fast graphics subsystem, dubbed project
                prism, will obviate the need to utilize older Java
                graphics windowing systems. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><b>It’s not how you feel, it’s how
                  you look. </b><span> </span>A superficial
                difference, but nonetheless one that should not be
                underestimated, lies in what your code looks like.<span>
                </span>In JavaFX Script, graphical Nodes are typically
                placed in the scenegraph via the definition of object
                literals.<span> </span><span> </span>Even the least
                sophisticated of object literal scenegraphs can be
                grouped and nested several levels deep, each nesting
                moving the source code further to the right.<span> </span>Some


                JavaFX Script code is so indented it leaves little room
                to write anything of consequence without having to split
                a line of code into two or more lines.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It didn’t take very long to come up
                with these talking points.<span> </span>No doubt, as
                development progresses and more folks jump on board,
                additional benefits will become apparent. </p>
