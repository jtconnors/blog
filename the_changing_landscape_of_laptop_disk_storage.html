    <big><b>The Changing Landscape of Laptop Solid State Storage</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 30 July 2018<br>
        <br>
      </small></small> In the hopes that those encountering the
    challenge of adding additional SSD storage to modern laptops may
    benefit from this learning experience...<br>
    <br>
    Among the more popular standard-issue corporate laptops, the Dell
    Latitude E-Series product line has proven to contain a good mix of
    the qualities many look for: a reasonably small footprint, powerful
    CPU options, full HD graphics and room to expand both RAM and
    disk.&nbsp; Of note, I've used a <a
href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/latitude-14-7000-series-ultrabook-e7440/spd/latitude-e7440-ultrabook">Dell







      E7440</a> laptop for three years and liked it enough that once the
    corporate lease was up, I looked to buy a used one for personal
    consumption.&nbsp; As the E7440 is a bit long in the tooth now, I
    instead opted for the slightly newer, faster version -- the <a
href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/latitude-14-7000-series-ultrabook-e7450/spd/latitude-e7450-ultrabook">E7450</a>.&nbsp;






    At the time of this publishing, these can be had on eBay for about
    $350 US.<br>
    <br>
    What at first seemed to be a simple upgrade from the previous
    generation turned out to have one rather important difference: <i>there






      is no supported secondary storage option on the Dell E7450</i>.<br>

    <br>
    As the image above demonstrates, the Dell E7440 on the left contains
    an expansion slot suitable for <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA#Mini-SATA_.28mSATA.29">mSATA</a>
    Solid State Drives whereas the connector on the right for the Dell
    E7450 instead includes a more generic (and more modern) <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#PCI_Express_Mini_Card">mini






      PCIe</a> slot.&nbsp; Cards for both, although somewhat similar at
    first glance, are not the same, do not have the same connectors and
    are incompatible.&nbsp; Here's what an mSata card looks like next to
    a 42mm mini PCIe card:<br>

    <br>
    <b>The Solution (for the impatient)<br>
      <br>
    </b>Not all mini PCIe cards are alike (more on this later).&nbsp; If
    you really don't feel like reading the rest of this article, one
    card has finally made it to market that does work in the Dell E7450
    mini PCIe slot.&nbsp; That card is the <i>Toshiba RC100 M.2 2242
      240GB PCIe SSD</i>, pictured directly below.<br>
    <br>

      height="225"><br>
    <br>
    Note:&nbsp; The SSD may not automagically appear once installed in,
    say a Windows 10 environment.&nbsp; It may need to be partitioned
    and formatted first.&nbsp; And of course, as to whether it's
    officially supported by Dell is another question entirely.<br>
    <br>
    <b>More on Mini PCIe<br>
      <br>
    </b>Its arguable Dell was ahead of the game with respect to SSD
    connectivity for the E7450.&nbsp; The PCIe standard, and in
    particular the M.2 connector, is rapidly becoming more and more
    common, slowly but surely rendering mSATA obsolete.&nbsp; In
    addition to being available in many form factors, M.2 SSDs come with
    slightly different edge connectors or keys (which ultimately
    determine read/write speed) and can follow the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA">SATA</a> or <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express">NVMe</a>
    (Non-Volatile Memory express) protocols.&nbsp; Let's examine these
    briefly now.<br>
    <br>
    <b>M.2 Form Factors<br>
    </b><br>
    M.2 cards come in many different widths (12, 16, 22 and 30 mm) and
    lengths (16, 26, 30, 38, 42, 60, 80 and 110 mm). Some of these
    combinations occur far more regularly than others.&nbsp; The most
    common M.2 SSDs use 22 mm width cards with lengths of 30, 42, 60, 80
    or 110 mm.&nbsp; A large majority of the M.2 SSDs currently
    available prefer the longer length form factors over the shorter
    ones, especially when considering larger capacity drives.<br>
    <br>
    Often times the M.2 card will specify the dimensions as part of the
    model number.&nbsp; For example, the working module for the Dell
    E7450 (mentioned above) is the <i>Toshiba RC100 M.2 <b>2242</b>
      240GB PCIe SSD.</i>&nbsp; The highlighted <i><b>2242</b></i>
    number indicates this card is 22 mm wide and 42 mm long.&nbsp; This
    form factor is not nearly as common as the longer types, and
    capacity is currently limited to no more than 256GB.&nbsp; No doubt
    as densities improve, this will change.&nbsp; The bottom line here
    is, the <b><i>Dell E7450 PCIe slot is made for a 22 mm wide 42 mm
        long M.2 cards</i></b>.&nbsp; The market for these types of SSDs
    are quite limited today.<br>
    <br>
    <b>M.2 Protocol for SSDs<br>
      <br>
    </b>M.2 SSDs are available as either supporting the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA">SATA</a> or the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express">PCIe NVMe</a>
    protocols.&nbsp; It is important to understand which of these
    protocols your laptop motherboard supports.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I
    was unaware of these differences, and in my ignorance initially
    purchased a Transcend 256GB SATA III MTS400 42 mm SSD.&nbsp; In the
    limited world of 42 mm M.2 SSDs, the SATA variety is by far and away
    the most prevalent and in fact until recently was the only
    option.&nbsp; Unfortunately the Dell E7450 does not support SATA on
    its PCIe interface.&nbsp; The picture that follows includes both
    PCIe M.2 SSDs.&nbsp; They both look the same.&nbsp; The Transcend
    device on the left won't work; the Toshiba device on the right does.<br>

    <br>
    <b><br>
      M.2 Connectors<br>
      <br>
    </b>We won't get into much detail here, suffice it to say the M.2
    edge connector can have different <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2#Form_factors_and_keying">keying






      and notch configurations</a> signifying among others,&nbsp;
    interfaces and transfer speeds.&nbsp; The cards in the image above
    are of the "B &amp; M key" edge connector variety.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Conclusion<br>

    </b>Here's the Dell Latitude E7450 with the Toshiba SSD installed.<br>
