    <p>In the financial services market, there is a general trend to
      move key systems close to, or even right inside the exchanges
      themselves -- the idea being that the nearer you are to the
      source, the less network infrastructure and latency you'll
      experience.&nbsp; With this advantage firms can potentially take
      on additional transaction loads at higher transaction rates.&nbsp;
      These systems typically use the latest Intel or AMD processors and
      run a commercial distribution of Linux.<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Indeed these co-located systems perform as expected <i>almost</i>
      all the time.&nbsp; But there are periodic intervals where the
      latency increases by several orders of magnitude, the
      ramifications of which could be financially disastrous.&nbsp;
      After eliminating other components, the street seems to be
      focusing its wrath on commercial Linux distributions and their
      lack of real-time capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      The linux community is actively working to include underpinnings
      to support real-time, but as of yet these capabilities are not
      part of a standard major (i.e. Red Hat, SuSE) distribution.&nbsp;
      Instead, an alternate version of linux with real-time extensions
      is offered.&nbsp; These extensions are in effect separate
      non-standard OS releases, and have not had the soak time required
      by many institutions.</p>
    <p>Back in the early 90's, I volunteered to move over to Sun's newly
      formed SunSoft business unit.&nbsp; One of it's main charters was
      to push the concept of running Solaris on alternate, i.e. Intel,
      platforms.&nbsp; (<i>Don't get me started here, can you imagine
        where Solaris would be right now if Sun had actually taken this
        initiative seriously back then?</i>)&nbsp; As part of that
      transition, I had the opportunity to take a Solaris Internals
      course, and couldn't help but notice the effort put in
      architecturally to address short latencies.&nbsp; I still have the
      course notebook; it is dated September 1993.</p>
    <p>The point is Solaris already has the real-time capabilities
      claimed by these add-on linux extensions.&nbsp; It is built into
      the operating system, has been for quite some time, is rock solid
      and doesn't require any additional components.&nbsp; A partial
      list of features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Real-time Scheduling Class</b> - In order to allow equal
        opportunity to system resources, traditional Unix schedulers
        transparently change process priorities to give competing
        processes a fair chance.&nbsp; Although well suited for
        timesharing systems, this is unacceptable real-time
        behavior.&nbsp; Since its outset, Solaris through its SVR4
        roots, introduced the concept of alternate scheduling
        classes.&nbsp; It includes a real-time scheduling class, which
        furnishes fixed-priority process scheduling at the highest
        priority levels in the system.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Fine-Grained Processor Control / Processor Sets</b> -
        Solaris allows threads and applications to be bound to specific
        individual processors. In addition, processors within a system
        can be grouped together as a processor set and dedicated to
        real-time tasks.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Here's a nice <a
          title="article describing processor sets"
          href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/solaris_processor.html">article




          describing processor sets</a>. Dated June 2001,&nbsp;
        processor sets have been a part of Solaris since release 2.6.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Interrupt Sheltering</b> - Available since Solaris 7, this
        feature enables CPUs to be sheltered from unbound
        interrupts.&nbsp; It can be used in conjunction with processor
        sets to shelter all CPUs in a processor set.&nbsp; Note: At
        least one processor in the system must be kept unsheltered. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Priority Inheritance</b> - Priority inversion occurs when a
        high-priority thread blocks on a resource that is held by a
        lower-priority thread. A runnable thread with a priority between
        the high and low-priority threads creates a priority inversion
        because it can receive processor resources ahead of the
        high-priority thread.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>To avoid priority inversions with kernel synchronization
      primitives, Solaris employs a transient priority inheritance
      protocol. The protocol enables the low-priority thread holding the
      resource to “inherit” the higher priority of the blocked
      high-priority thread. This approach gives the blocking
      low-priority thread the CPU resources it needs to complete its
      task as soon as possible so that it can release the
      synchronization primitive. Upon completion, all threads are
      returned to their respective priorities by the kernel.<sup>3</sup><br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><b>High Resolution Timers</b> - Solaris 8 introduces the
        cyclic subsystem; this allows for timers of much better
        granularity -- in the microsecond and nanosecond range --
        without burdening the system with a high interrupt rate.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Memory Locking</b> - The paging in and out of data from
        disk to memory may be considered normal behavior for virtual
        memory systems, but it is unacceptable for real-time
        applications.&nbsp; Solaris addresses this problem by allowing
        the locking down of a process' pages into memory, using <a
          href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5168/6mbb3hrhq?a=view"
          title="mlock(3C)">mlock(3C)</a> or <a
          href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5168/6mbb3hrhr?a=view"
          title="mlockall(3C)">mlockall(3C)</a> system calls.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Early Binding</b> - By default, linking of dynamic
        libraries in the Solaris is done on an as-needed basis. The
        runtime binding for a dynamically linked function isn't
        determined until its first invocation. Though flexible, this
        behavior can induce indeterminism and unpredictable jitter in
        the timing of a real-time application. To avoid jitter, the
        Solaris provides for early binding of dynamic libraries. By
        setting the LD_BIND_NOW environment variable to "1", libraries
        are bound at application startup time. Using early binding
        together with memory locking is a very effective approach to
        avoiding jitter.<sup>4</sup></li>

    <p>So why not give Solaris more consideration?&nbsp; It's way more
      mature.&nbsp; And in the unlikely event (chcukle, chuckle) that a
      lower-latency OS might not solve all your performance problems,
      I'd put my money on Solaris and <a
