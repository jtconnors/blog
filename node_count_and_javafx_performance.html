    <p>In a recent blog entry entitled <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/michaelheinrichs/entry/best_practices_for_javafx_mobile1">Best




        Practices for JavaFX Mobile Applications (Part 2)</a>, Michael
      Heinrichs espouses that keeping the scenegraph as small as
      possible helps JavaFX applications perform optimally. Regardless
      what version of JavaFX you're using, this is sage advice.&nbsp;
      Having spent some time trying to create components for a
      scoreboard-like application, I was concerned over the amount of
      CPU time being consumed by the clock component pictured directly
      below.</p>

    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>You can click on the preceding image to run this mini application
      via Java WebStart.&nbsp;&nbsp; By placing your mouse over any of
      the digits and typing in, via keyboard input, a valid number, you
      can set the clock.&nbsp; Clicking on the "START/STOP" text will
      toggle the clock on and off.&nbsp; Like many scoreboard clocks,
      when the time remaining is less than one minute, 10ths of seconds
      are displayed.&nbsp; It is during this phase, when digits are
      being updated every tenth of a second, that this application can
      be especially taxing.&nbsp; You can imagine how troublesome this
      clock might be if it were to be part of say a hockey scoreboard
      which could have an additional 4 penalty clocks ticking
      simultaneously.</p>
    <p>The major factor affecting performance appears to be the sheer
      number of nodes in the scenegraph that require recalculation for
      every clock tick.&nbsp; For this first implementation, each of the
      five clock digits is comprised of 27 <font face="courier
        new,courier,monospace">BulbNode</font>s, (my naming) which are
      switched on or off depending upon what value needs to be
      displayed.</p>
    <p>In an effort to see how decreasing the node count might effect
      performance, this second implementation of the clock component
      uses the same underlying framework, except that each digit is now
      composed of 7 LED <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SegmentNode</font>s
      (my naming again) instead of 27 <font face="courier
        new,courier,monospace">BulbNode</font>s. &nbsp; You can run this
      version of the clock component by clicking on the image that
      follows.</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="resource/javafx-node-perf/LEDClockNode.jpg"
        width="400" height="160"><br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>For our final example, in order to truly minimize node count,
      each digit is represented by a single <font face="courier
        new,courier,monospace">ImageView</font> node. When the value of
      a digit changes, a new <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Image</font>
      is displayed.&nbsp; By caching all of the possible digit values
      (blank, 0-9) you can very quickly switch images.&nbsp; No doubt,
      prettier images can be created, but I think you get the
      point.&nbsp; Click on the image that follows to try this version.<br>

    <p>The slower the compute platform, the more pronounced the
      differences in performance should be.&nbsp; Thinking along those
      lines, a very modest 1.4 GHz Pentium M laptop was chosen as the
      test environment to compare CPU utilization for these
      applications.&nbsp; OpenSolaris provides an easy-to-use well-known
      command-line tool called <a
href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23823_01/html/816-5166/vmstat-1m.html#scrolltoc">vmstat(1M)</a>,
      which was chosen as the mechanism to analyze the individual
      applications. In contrast, the Performance Tab which is part of
      the Windows Task Manager, seemed to produce wild performance
      variations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For each run,&nbsp; the clocks were set to one minute, and run
      until the time expired.&nbsp; The data shown below represents the
      average CPU utilization, after startup, for each of the three
      implementations.&nbsp; In particular we'll look at the following
      fields returned by <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">vmstat</font>:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>us</strong> - percentage usage of CPU time in <em>user</em>
        space<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>sy</strong> - percentage usage of CPU time in <em>system</em>
        space<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>id</strong> - percentage usage of CPU time idling</li>
    </ul>
    The sum of (us + sy + id) should approximate 100%.

      The JavaFX engineering team is well aware of this limitation, and
      hopes to redesign the underlying scenegraph plumbing in the
      future.&nbsp; Regardless, it's still a good idea to take into
      consideration the size of your scenegraph.</p>
