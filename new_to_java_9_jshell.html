    <big><b>New for Java 9: jshell</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 24 July 2015</small></small><br>
    <p>A sampling of indices gauging computer programming language
      popularity (e.g. <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">PYPL</a>
      and <a
        href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE</a>)
      shows that Java, after 20 years, still enjoys a huge
      following.&nbsp; In general, depending upon whom and/or when you
      ask, Java usually comes in first or second place in these
      surveys.&nbsp; Although it might be hard to imagine recent
      computer science graduates without Java exposure, one trend is
      evident: top universities are gravitating towards teaching
      "simpler" languages in lieu of Java for their introductory
      programming classes.</p>

    <p>The standard Java platform, compared to its counterparts like
      Python, currently lacks a <i>Read-Eval-Print-Loop</i> otherwise
      known as a <i>REPL</i>.&nbsp; Instead of having to construct and
      compile complete syntactically correct programs before feedback
      can be achieved, REPLs allow much more interactivity, enabling the
      student/programmer to enter small snippets of code and receive
      immediate feedback.&nbsp; According to the <a
        href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/222">Java Enhancement
        Proposal</a> which outlines the new jshell functionality, "The
      number one reason schools cite for moving away from Java as a
      teaching language is that other languages have a "REPL" and have
      far lower bars to an initial <code class="prettyprint">"Hello,
        world!"</code> program."&nbsp; With the introduction of jshell
      in the upcoming Java 9 release, this shortcoming will be
      eliminated.</p>
    <p>Falling under the auspices of an OpenJDK project called <a
        href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/">Kulla</a>, the
      code representing the REPL capability has yet to be incorporated
      into the core <a href="http://jdk.java.net/9/">JDK 9 early access
        release</a>.&nbsp; As of the writing of this article (late July
      2015), a separate build is required to get the jshell
      functionality.&nbsp; In the (hopefully not-too-distant) future an
      early access release will bundle all these features together
      obviating the need for extra work.&nbsp; In the interim, here's a
      brief video demonstrating some of it's features.<br>

    <p>As we near the "feature complete" phase for JDK 9, we look
      forward to better integration and incorporation of yet more new
      important features into this upcoming release.</p>
