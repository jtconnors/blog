    <big><b>Serial Port Communication for Java SE Embedded</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 18 August 2011</small></small><br>
    <br>
    The need to communicate with devices connected to serial ports is a
    common application requirement.&nbsp; Falling outside the purview of
    the Java SE platform, serial and parallel port communication has
    been addressed with a project called <a
      href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">RXTX</a>.&nbsp;



    (In the past, you may have known this as javacomm).&nbsp; With
    RXTX,&nbsp; Java developers access serial ports through the
    RXTXcomm.jar file.&nbsp; Alongside this jar file, an underlying
    native layer must be provided to interface with the operating
    system's UART ports.&nbsp; For the usual suspects (Windows,
    Linux/x86, MacOS, Solaris/Sparc), pre-compiled binaries are readily
    available.&nbsp; To host this on an alternative platform, some
    (hopefully minimal) amount of work is required.
    <p>Here's hoping the following notes/observations might aid in
      helping you to build RXTX for an embedded device utilizing one of
      our <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/overview/javase/index.html">Java


        SE Embedded</a> binaries.&nbsp; The device used for this
      particular implementation is my current favorite: the <a
        href="http://www.plugcomputer.org/">Plug Computer</a>.</p>
    <p>Notes on Getting RX/TX 2.1-7-r2 Working on a Plug Computer<br>
      <br>
      1. At this early juncture with Java 7, be wary of mixing Java 7
      with code from older versions of Java. The class files generated
      by the JDK7 javac compiler contain an updated version byte with a
      value that results in older (Java 6 and before) JVMs refusing to
      load these classes.<br>
      <br>
      2. The RXTX download location <a
        href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download">http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download</a>
      has binaries for many platforms including Arm variants, but none
      that worked for the Plug Computer, so one had to be built from
      source.<br>
      <br>
      3. Using the native GCC for the Plug Computer and the RXTX source,
      binaries (native shared objects) were compiled for the
      armv5tel-unknown-linux-gnu platform.<br>
      <br>
      4. The RXTX "stable" source code found at the aforementioned site
      is based on version rxtx 2.1-7r2.&nbsp; This code appears to be
      pretty long in the tooth, in that it has no knowledge of Java
      6.&nbsp; Some changes need to be made to accommodate a JDK 6
      environment.&nbsp; Without these modifications, RXTX will not
      build with JDK6<br>
      <br>
      SUGGESTED FIX, most elegant, not recommended:<br>
      Edit the configure.in file in the source directory and look for
      the following:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case $JAVA_VERSION in
    1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*)
</pre>
    <p>and change the second line to:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*|1.6*)
</pre>
    <p>Upon modification, the autogen.sh script found in the rxtx source
      directory must be re-run to recreate the ./configure script.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, this requires loading the autoconf, automake and
      libtool packages (plus dependencies) and ended up resulting in
      libtool incompatibilies when running the resultant ./configure
      script.<br>
      <br>
      RECOMMENDED FIX:<br>
      Instead, edit ./configure and search for the occurrences (there
      are more than one) of<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case $JAVA_VERSION in
    1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*)
</pre>
    <p>and change the second line to:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2*|1.3*|1.4*|1.5*|1.6*)
</pre>
    <p>Run './configure', then 'make' to generate the RXTXcomm.jar and
      platform specific .so shared object libraries.<br>
      <br>
      5. You may also notice in the output of the make, that there were
      compilation errors for source files which failed to find the
      meaning of "UTS_RELEASE".&nbsp; This results in some of the shared
      object files not being created.&nbsp; These pertain to the
      non-serial aspects of RXTX.&nbsp; As we were only interested in
      librxtxSerial.so, this was no problem for us.<br>
      <br>
      6. Once built, move the following files into the following
      directories:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # cd rxtx-2.1-7-r2/
    # cp RXTXcomm.jar $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext
    # cd armv5tel-unknown-linux-gnu/.libs/
    # cp librxtxSerial-2.1-7.so $JAVA_HOME/lib/arm
    # cd $JAVA_HOME/lib/arm
    # ln -s librxtxSerial-2.1-7.so librxtxSerial.so
</pre>
    <p>Now Java applications which utilize RXTX should run without any
      java command-line additions.</p>
