    <p>Despite the considerable attention JavaFX has garnered,
      publications (i.e. books) that discuss JavaFX in any detail are
      few and far between, and anything that has been published, as good
      as it may have been, is unfortunately hopelessly out of
      date.&nbsp; The reality is that up until recently, the JavaFX
      platform has been a moving target.&nbsp; With the advent of JavaFX
      1.1 however, the platform has stabilized to the point where you
      should begin to see legitimate books appearing on the subject.</p>
    <p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/clarkeman/">Jim Clarke</a>, <a
        href="http://ericbruno.com/">Eric Bruno</a> and I have been
      working steadfastly on a book entitled <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaFX-Developing-Rich-Internet-Applications/dp/013701287X"><i><b>JavaFX:



            Developing Rich Internet Applications</b></i></a>, which
      should be among the first -- if not the first -- of these new
      books.&nbsp; From our standpoint the content is nearly
      finished.&nbsp; What remains is the editing and publication
      process which takes a few additional months to complete.&nbsp;
      Plans call for this book to be available in time for the <a
        href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne 2009
        Conference</a>, if not earlier. <br>
    </p>
    <p>We also plan on making rough cuts of certain chapters available
      on Safari.&nbsp; As soon as these are ready, we'll let you
      know.&nbsp; Finally, check out our website, <a
        href="http://jfxbook.com">jfxbook.com</a>, dedicated to the
      book.&nbsp; There you will find additional resources that
      accompany the book, including sample code and applications.&nbsp;
      One such application is a JavaFX version of the popular Sudoku
      game, pictured below.</p>
