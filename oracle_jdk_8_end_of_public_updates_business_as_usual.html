    <b>Oracle JDK 8 End of Public Updates: Business as Usual</b><br>
    <small>By Jim Connors 15 January 2019</small><br>
    <p>January 15, 2019 marks the final public update for the Oracle
      Java SE 8 release.&nbsp; Henceforth referred to as Oracle JDK 8
      (to avoid any confusion with <a
        data-cke-saved-href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8u/"
        href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8u/">Open JDK 8</a>),
      this update culminates approximately 5 years of free commercial
      use and support under the terms of the <a
href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html">Oracle




        Binary Code License Agreement</a>.&nbsp; Speaking from countless
      interactions, there is a fair amount of customer confusion and
      uncertainty concerning the fate of Oracle JDK 8 and Java going
      forward.&nbsp; I hope these next few paragraphs provide some
      clarity.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There are two important facts regarding Java releases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>The Java End of Public Update (EoPU) process has
            been taking place since the earliest days of Java back at <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun
              Microsystems</a></em></strong>. &nbsp; All major Java
        releases eventually end their public lifetime, in the past
        typically once a newer major release was established.&nbsp;
        Oracle has continued this tradition (for nearly 9 years now),
        and in the case of JDK 6, extended its public lifetime longer
        than any other Java release, pre or post Sun acquisition.&nbsp;
        <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/extension-of-oracle-java-se-8-public-updates-and-java-web-start-support">Announced




          and extended back in January, 2018</a>, once the final public
        update runs its course, Oracle JDK 8 will have had a public
        lifetime in excess of 5 years.</li>
      <li><em><strong>A commercial Java offering has been available for
            many years, predating Oracle's acquisition of Sun</strong></em>.&nbsp;





        There are a couple of good reasons why.&nbsp; First,
        organizations who run their critical business applications on
        top of the Java platform want traditional 24/7 support.&nbsp;
        Considering its importance, it makes some sense to have that
        insurance policy to help diagnose and fix difficult problems
        that might interrupt normal business activity.&nbsp; Second, and
        arguably more importantly, commercial Java support enables
        customers to remain on older Java releases past EoPU.&nbsp; Many
        customers simply do not or cannot migrate to new major versions
        of Java.&nbsp; The ability to stay on the older releases while
        receiving the latest critical security updates only increases in
        importance as sensitivity to security increases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Referencing the figure above, let's look at the trajectory of the
      JDK 7 release to get a better understanding.&nbsp; Introduced in
      July 2011, JDK 7 had a public lifetime just under 4 years.&nbsp;
      The last public update (7u80) was released in April 2015.&nbsp;
      Since that time, Oracle has continued patching JDK 7, fixing all
      known critical vulnerabilities and <a

        href="https://www.oracle.com/java/java-se-subscription.html">making




        those updates available to its commercial customers</a>.&nbsp;
      As of this article's publish date, the current JDK 7 update is
      7u211, and it cumulatively patches a total of 182 security
      vulnerabilities since the time of the last public update.&nbsp;
      The public versions of the Oracle JDK <a
data-cke-saved-href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html"
href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html">are,
        and will continue to be, free to download use</a>, however, as
      time passes, those aging public releases will without question
      become increasingly exposed.&nbsp; The question becomes whether
      organizations are willing to assume that risk.</p>
    <p>Starting with JDK9, based on feedback from the community, <a
data-cke-saved-href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/faster-and-easier-use-and-redistribution-of-java-se"
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/faster-and-easier-use-and-redistribution-of-java-se">Oracle




        has accelerated the Java release cadence to every 6 months</a>.&nbsp;





      Each of these 6 month releases will be freely available, supported
      and updated for 6 months and only six months.&nbsp; Customers who
      wish to stay on releases longer than 6 months with updates and
      support have that option via the <a

    <p>In conclusion, current Oracle JDK customers have options -- three
      to speak of -- with regards to Java going forward, two of which
      entail no commercial obligation to Oracle or any other
      organization:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can continue to use the current publicly available
        releases as you do now indefinitely.&nbsp; Oracle maintains an <a
data-cke-saved-href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html"
href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html">archive




          of old Java downloads</a> that enables you to get at these
        releases at any time.&nbsp; The one concern here is, over time,
        these releases will be increasing exposed to known security
        vulnerabilities.&nbsp; If you are willing to assume that risk,
        then you're all set.</li>
      <li>If you are concerned about maintaining the latest security
        baseline, you can opt to follow the new 6 month Java release
        cadence.&nbsp; These 6 month releases are updated twice during
        their lifetime with the latest security patches and are free to
        use under the GPLv2 with <a
          data-cke-saved-href="http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html"
          href="http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html">the
          Classpath Exception License</a>.</li>
      <li>There are a whole host of good reasons why; if your
        organization would find it difficult if not impossible to move
        at the rapid 6 month cadence, you have the option of staying on
        of Oracle's designated Long Term Support (LTS) releases, and
        migrating to subsequent LTS releases at your pace.&nbsp; These
        LTS releases are supported and updated with the latest security
        patches for 8 years and are available to customers via the <a
