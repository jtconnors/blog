    <big><b>JDK9 keytool Transitions Default Keystore to PKCS12</b></big><br>
    <small>By Jim Connors 24-Oct-2017</small><br>
    <br>
    When it comes to the JDK9 release, <a
      href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw">project jigsaw</a>
    garners nearly all the attention, sucking the air out of the room
    and leaving very little oxygen for many other smaller but
    interesting enhancements. One such feature addresses the universal
    quest to modernize overall security and involves an improvement to
    the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/keytool.htm">keytool</a>
    utility. For approximately two decades, Java and keytool had relied
    on the JDK-specific JKS keystore type as its default store. As
    specified by <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/229">JEP 229</a>,
    JDK9 transitions the default keystore to <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12">PKCS12</a>.<br>
    <br>
    This change means that any new keystores will be created in the
    PKCS12 format.&nbsp; It should however not affect existing
    applications that rely upon the original JKS keystore type.&nbsp;
    Backwards compatibility will be maintained allowing existing
    applications to continue operating unmodified for the foreseeable
    future.<br>
    <br>
    PKCS12 has a number of advantages:
    <ol>
      <li>It is more extensible</li>
      <li>It supports stronger cryptographic algorithms</li>
      <li>It is widely adopted.&nbsp; PKCS12 is frequently the format
        provided by certificate authorities when issuing certificates.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With respect to point (3) above, <a
        href="installing_trusted_certificates_into_a.html">as mentioned
        in this previous article</a>, keytool has historically been
      unable to directly import PKCS12 generated trusted keys and
      certificates, and instead must rely on external workarounds like
      the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use openssl to create a keystore containing the certificate
        chain and private key. Then use keytool to import this keystore
        into either a new or larger keystore..</li>
      <li>Platforms like Oracle WebLogic contain a
        utils.ImportPrivateKey class (with a main method) that is
        included in weblogic.jar which can accomplish this task</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unfortunately this shortcoming still exists in JDK9.&nbsp;
      However a request for enhancement has been recently been created
      and can be found here:&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>keytool should be able to import
        private keys:</em> <a

    <p>Perhaps enough folks can weigh in and vote, increasing its
      priority.<br>
