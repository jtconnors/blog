    <p>The brief but brilliant era of computing has seen companies come
      and go, many relegated to the ash heap of history because they
      failed to heed this simple rule:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long run general purpose solutions
        will always win out over specialized proprietary ones.&nbsp;</i>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      As a long time employee of Sun Microsystems, I've witnessed
      firsthand the effects, both positive and negative, that this law
      has had on my company.&nbsp; Sun can attribute it's initial
      meteoric rise to the fact that it offered a viable alternative to
      the popular minicomputer platform of the day.&nbsp; The first Sun
      workstations were built from commercial off-the-shelf components,
      and although nearly equal in performance to the minicomputer, they
      were so much more affordable that they became good enough.&nbsp;
      And of course over time, as Moore's law might dictate, those
      initial deficiencies quickly dissipated, and in fact surpassed
      traditional minicomputer capabilities.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Somewhere along the line Sun lost sight of this ideal and began
      incorporating more proprietary technology into their
      products.&nbsp; At first the strategy appeared to be successful as
      Sun was well positioned to reap huge benefits during the Internet
      bubble.&nbsp; Meanwhile, low-cost general purpose servers were
      continuously improving.&nbsp; When the bubble burst they in turn
      became good enough alternatives to the powerful but costly Sun
      servers.&nbsp; The resulting decline of Sun was rapid, and it's
      taken the better part of a decade for us to recover.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This story has been told -- and will continue to be again and
      again -- for those refusing to learn this lesson.&nbsp; A
      professor of mine once told me, "If there's anything we've learned
      from history, it's that we haven't learned anything from history".</p>
    <p>When markets mature, even those where technology is paramount,
      economic considerations dominate. General purpose systems scale on
      every dimension (unit, management, training and integration costs)
      whereas proprietary systems do not.&nbsp; A switch to more
      standard components should in no way be construed as stifling
      innovation.&nbsp; Rather, general purpose systems help create new
      innovation by building from common elements economically appealing
      in their own right, and presumably even more economically
      beneficial once combined.<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Real-time industrial controllers could be the next market ripe
      for disruption.&nbsp; Admittedly this is an entrenched and
      conservative lot.&nbsp; But the economics of general purpose
      computing cannot be denied.&nbsp; As organizations strive to
      further eliminate cost out of their system, revisiting usage and
      deployment of industrial controllers, typically via custom
      proprietary <a title="PLCs"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller">PLCs</a>,
      is falling under review.&nbsp; Consequently, at the behest of one
      of the world's largest industrial corporations, Sun has partnered
      with <a title="iGoLogic" href="http://www.igologic.com/">iGoLogic</a>,
      a systems integrator, and <a title="Axiomtek"
        href="http://www.axiomtek.com/">Axiomtek</a>, an industrial PC
      board manufacturer, to create the real-time controller platform
      pictured below.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Among others, here are some of the compelling benefits of this
      platform:&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>It's based on standard x86 hardware.</b>&nbsp; The
        motherboards aren't much larger than a postcard, are energy
        efficient, and yet have PC class processing power.&nbsp; The
        number of competing manufacturers in this space eliminates
        vendor lock-in and insures price sensitivity and further rapid
        innovation. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>It runs on standard <a title="Solaris"
            href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a></b><b>.</b>&nbsp;





        No custom proprietary real-time operating system is
        required.&nbsp; <a title="One of the best kept secrets of
          Solaris" href="solaris_was_real_time_before.html">One of the
          best kept secrets of Solaris</a> is its real-time
        capabilities. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Real-time applications are developed using <a title="Sun's
            Java Real-Time System"
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/fullyconcurrentgarbagecollector-137267.html">Sun's





            Java Real-Time System</a></b>, enabling you to leverage the
        largest development community on the planet.&nbsp; Obscure
        development languages and highly specialized environments are
        longer needed. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Industrial Networking Protocols (e.g <a title="Profibus"
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profibus">PROFIBUS</a>, <a
          title="Ethercat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethercat">EtherCAT</a>)
        are easily migrated to this platform, partly because of the
        wealth of development tools available.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The system utilizes an IDE flash drive from <a title="Apacer"
href="http://usa.apacer.com/us/products/Embedded_Flash_Solutions_PATA_Flash_Series.htm">Apacer</a>.&nbsp;





        In addition to eliminating the moving parts associated with a
        traditional disk drive, it consumes less power and makes the
        system more resistant to shock and vibration.&nbsp; Overcoming
        the longevity limitations of flash memory, Apacer has done some
        interesting work on wear leveling algorithms effectively
        extending the lifetime of the flash device well past the
        expected lifetime of the industrial controller.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    Let this be our first salvo fired over the proprietary industrial
    encampment.&nbsp; We believe the opportunity is immense, but also
    understand that to achieve any measure of success, partnering with
    organizations who are truly experts in this arena is critical.&nbsp;
    If you think you can add further value, we'd love to talk.<br>
