    Arm processors come in all makes and sizes, a certain percentage of
    which address a market where cost, footprint and power requirements
    are at a premium.&nbsp; In this space, the inclusion of even a
    floating point unit would be considered an unnecessary luxury.&nbsp;
    To perform floating point operations with these processors, software
    emulation is required.
    <p>Higher-end Arm processors come bundled with additional capability
      that enables hardware execution of floating point
      operations.&nbsp; The difference between these two architectures
      gave rise to two separate Embedded Application Binary Interfaces
      or EABIs for ARM: <i>soft float</i> and <i>VFP (Vector Floating
        Point)</i>.&nbsp; Although there is forward compatibility
      between soft and hard float, there is no backward
      compatibility.&nbsp; And in fact, when it comes to providing
      binaries for <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">Java


        SE Embedded for Arm</a>, Oracle provides two separate options: a
      soft float binary and a VFP binary.&nbsp; In the Linux community,
      releases built upon both these EABIs are refereed to as <i>armel</i>
      based distributions.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Enter <i>armhf</i>.&nbsp; Although a big step up in
      performance, the VFP EABI utilizes less-than-optimal argument
      passing when a floating point operations take place.&nbsp; In this
      scenario, floating point arguments must first be passed through
      integer registers prior to executing in the floating point
      unit.&nbsp; A new EABI, referred to as <i>armhf</i> optimizes the
      calling convention for floating point operations by passing
      arguments directly into floating point registers.&nbsp; It
      furthermore includes a more efficient system call
      convention.&nbsp; The end result is applications compiled with the
      <i>armhf</i> standard should demonstrate modest performance
      improvement in some cases, and significant improvement for
      floating point intensive applications.</p>
    <p>Alas, <i>armhf</i> represents yet another binary incompatible
      standard, but one that has already gained considerable traction in
      the community. Although still relatively early, the transition
      from <i>armel</i> to <i>armhf</i> is underway.&nbsp; In fact, <a
href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2012-November/036106.html">Ubuntu


        has already announced that future releases will only be built to
        the <i>armhf</i> standard</a>, effectively obsoleting <i>armel</i>.
      As mentioned in <a
href="https://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/oracle_releases_jdk_for_linux">Henrik's


        Stahl's Blog</a>, an <i>armhf</i> version of Java SE Embedded
      is in the works, and we have already made available a <a
href="http://jdk8.java.net/fxarmpreview/javafx-arm-developer-preview.html"><i>armhf</i>-based


        developer Preview of JDK 8 with JavaFX</a>.</p>
    <p>In the interim, we will have to deal with the incompatibilities
      between <i>armel</i> and <i>armhf</i>.&nbsp; Most recently we've
      seen a rash of failed attempts to run the ArmV7 VFP Java SE
      Embedded binary on top of an <i>armhf</i>-based Linux
      distro.&nbsp; During diagnosis, the question becomes, how can I
      determine whether my Linux distribution is based on <i>armel</i>
      or <i>armhf</i>?&nbsp; Turns out this is not as straightforward
      as one might think.&nbsp; Aside from experience and anecdotal
      evidence, one possible way to ascertain whether you're running on
      <i>armel</i> or <i>armhf</i> is to run the following obscure
      command: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>$ readelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep Tag_ABI_VFP_args</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If the <tt>Tag_ABI_VFP_args</tt> tag is found, then you're
      running on an <i>armhf</i> system.&nbsp; If nothing is returned,
      then it's <i>armel</i>.&nbsp; To show you an example, here's what
      happens on a Raspberry Pi running the <a
        href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> distribution:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>pi@raspberrypi:~$ readelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep
          Tag_ABI_VFP_args<br>
          &nbsp; Tag_ABI_VFP_args: VFP registers</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This indicates an <i>armhf</i> distro, which in fact is what
      Raspbian is.&nbsp; On the original, <a
        href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">soft-float Debian
        Wheezy</a> distribution, here's what happens:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>pi@raspberrypi:~$ readelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep
          Tag_ABI_VFP_args</tt> <br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Nothing returned indicates that this is indeed <i>armel</i>.</p>
