      </small>This week marks the <a

        release of JavaFX 1.0</a>.&nbsp; During the interval between the
      early marketing blitz and now, we've heard a lot from our friends
      in the press and the blogosphere, and in many instances what they
      had to say was not very pretty.&nbsp; Some think the <i>Rich
        Internet Application</i> platform battle lines are already drawn
      between Adobe and Microsoft, and dismiss Sun as having arrived too
      late to the party.&nbsp; Others opine that JavaFX's underlying
      Java platform is so yesterday.&nbsp; In fact Java is the primary
      reason why JavaFX will, much to the chagrin of many, receive
      serious consideration.&nbsp; Here's why:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Java is ubiquitous</b>.&nbsp; It is the proven, de-facto
        platform for web-based deployment.&nbsp; On the desktop, it is
        estimated that approximately 90% of PCs have Java installed. In
        fact the major PC OEMs have seen fit to install it for you out
        of the box.&nbsp; In the mobile world, Java is the dominant
        deployment platform.&nbsp; Billions (that's with a 'b') of
        devices run Java. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Java development community is arguably the largest on
          the planet</b>.&nbsp; Java gained initial widespread acclaim
        as a productive development environment, and continues to do
        so.&nbsp; As JavaFX is an evolution of Java and seamlessly
        integrates with it, human nature tells us that individuals will
        naturally want to work with and leverage that which they already
        know and are familiar with.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Alternatives are still no match for the Java Virtual
          Machine</b>.&nbsp; It has been extensively studied, vetted,
        scrutinized, poked, prodded, abused, cloned, and optimized more
        than any other virtual machine in the history of computing. And
        just in case you're under the impression that the Java Virtual
        Machine is limited only to the Java (and now JavaFX script)
        programming languages, think again.&nbsp; At last count there
        were over 200 projects integrating modern dynamic languages to
        the Java VM.&nbsp; That list includes the usual suspects like
        PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Python, and [insert your favorite
        language here]. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The amount of Java Standard Edition online updates is
          staggering</b>.&nbsp; We know.&nbsp; We supply the
        downloads.&nbsp; And once a desktop is upgraded, it will be able
        to take full advantage of the features JavaFX brings to the
        table, effectively trivializing the barriers to entry.</li>
    </ul>
    Many of our most talented folks have been working feverishly to
    reach this milestone.&nbsp; That being said, there's still lot's
    more work to do.&nbsp; But we're off to a real nice start.&nbsp;

    Hmm.&nbsp; looks like the site is a little sluggish right now.&nbsp;
    Maybe we underestimated all the interest?<br>
