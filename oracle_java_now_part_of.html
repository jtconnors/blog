    <p>Having sold more than <a
        href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5016">1.75 million
        units in its brief lifespan</a>, there is no denying the
      profound impact the Raspberry Pi has had on the embedded
      development community.&nbsp; Amid all the hoopla surrounding the
      recently completed <a
        href="http://www.oracle.com/openworld/index.html">Oracle
        OpenWorld</a> and <a
        href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">Java One</a>
      events, one announcement that flew under the radar dealt with the
      fact that the <i>Oracle JDK is now part of the Raspberry Pi
        Raspian distribution</i>. </p>
    <p>This means that by default, when you download and install the
      latest Raspian distribution on your Raspberry Pi,&nbsp;the Oracle
      Java runtime environment and development
      tools&nbsp;are&nbsp;automatically part of the list of packages
      installed.&nbsp; Here's a screenshot showing a login session to a
      Raspberry Pi running the 2013-09-25-wheezy-raspian
      distribution.&nbsp; The JDK is installed as the <i>oracle-java7-jdk</i>
      package and is utilizing the Java 7u40 release. <br>

    <p>For those who either cannot or do not wish to perform an entire
      Raspian upgrade, the Oracle JDK is available via the following
      command: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Great news. <br>
