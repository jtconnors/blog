    <p><big><b>Using Java Flight Recorder Triggers</b></big><br>

    <p>A&nbsp;good amount has been written and said about <a

        Flight Recorder</a>, its integration into the Oracle Java SE
      Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the very low overhead associated
      with enabling the framework.&nbsp; It not only makes the
      notion&nbsp;of collecting detailed runtime information about a
      Java application <strong><em>in production</em></strong> a
      possibility, it makes it a reality.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Many opt to place&nbsp;a program&nbsp;in Java Flight
      Recorder's&nbsp;<strong><em>Continuous Recording Mode</em></strong>.&nbsp;














      In this state, the Java application will collect runtime data
      indefinitely, where you can specify (or default to) how much data
      you want to&nbsp;retain before overwriting.&nbsp; Once in this
      mode, you can at any time, with many different options, <em>dump</em>
      the runtime information into a self-contained flight recorder
      file.&nbsp; From there, the <a

        Mission Control</a> tool can be used to open this file to
      further diagnose your running application's behavior.</p>
    <p>Rather than randomly or periodically taking Flight Recorder
      dumps, it is also possible to conditionally do so.&nbsp; That is
      to say, you can, though the use of <strong><em>triggers</em></strong>,
      create rules that will cause a flight recorder dump to take place
      when a defined condition is met.&nbsp; It's hopefully not
      difficult to envision that in this scenario triggers could help
      you&nbsp;focus on detailed runtime information when things start
      to go bad, as opposed to looking at a much larger data set.&nbsp;
      The video that follows goes through a simple session,
      demonstrating how to trigger a Flight Recording dump (7 minutes
      into the video) and briefly uses Mission Control to diagnose the
      sample application's behavior based on reading the dumped flight
      recording.</p>
