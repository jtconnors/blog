    <big><b>Java ONE 2011 Hands on Lab for Java SE Embedded</b></big><br>
    <small><small>By Jim Connors 24 October 2011</small></small><br>
    <p> Now that the dust has settled, sincere thanks go out to my
      compadres (you know who you are) for helping make The Java One
      2011 Java SE Embedded Hands on Lab such a success.&nbsp; In fact
      it was so well received, our peers in Asia are already planning on
      replicating the effort for JavaOne Tokyo in April 2012.&nbsp; In
      addition to the Tokyo event,&nbsp; we hope to provide future
      opportunities for this venue elsewhere.&nbsp; In the interim, we'd
      seriously consider hosting this lab, albeit on a smaller scale
      (Java One had 105 networked devices and workstations), for
      interested customers.&nbsp; To give you a feel for the lab
      contents, here's a synopsis:</p>
    <p><i>Java One 2011 Hands on Lab 24642: Java SE Embedded Development
        Made Easy <br>
        <br>
        This Hands-on Lab aims to show that developers already familiar
        with the Java develop/debug/deploy lifecycle can apply those
        same skills to develop Java applications, using Java SE
        Embedded, on embedded devices.&nbsp; Each participant in the lab
        will: </i> <i><br>
      </i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Have their own individual embedded device to gain valuable
          hands on experience </i></li>
      <li><i>Turn their embedded device into a Java Servlet container </i></li>
      <li><i>Learn how to deploy embedded Java applications, developed
          with the NetBeans IDE, onto their device </i></li>
      <li><i>Learn how embedded Java applications can be remotely
          debugged from their desktop NetBeans IDE </i></li>
      <li><i>Learn how to remotely monitor and manage embedded Java
          applications from their desktop</i></li>
    </ul>
    If the logistics for setting up a lab prove to be a bit too much, as
    an alternative, we've given quite a few live
    presentations/demonstrations with similar flair.&nbsp; So please, by
    all means, contact me at <a href="mailto:james.connors@oracle.com">james.connors@oracle.com</a>,
    if you're interested in learning more.&nbsp; For those of you who
    run developer user groups, most notably Java User Groups, and are
    looking for a speaker at your next meeting, please consider
    us.&nbsp; We will not disappoint.<br>
