    <p>Among other benefits, the <a

        SE Advanced</a> offering&nbsp;provides customers&nbsp;with
      access to&nbsp;security&nbsp;patches for Java releases that are no
      longer publicly updated.&nbsp; And as a result, many
      of&nbsp;these&nbsp;organizations have become diligent --
      deservedly so --&nbsp;in keeping up to date with&nbsp;Oracle's
      quarterly cadence.&nbsp; If you are one of those customers who
      falls into this category, you may have&nbsp;noticed that&nbsp;<strong><em>the







          most recent&nbsp;October </em>2017&nbsp;updates for
        Java&nbsp;6 (6u171) and Java 7 (7u161) will no longer include a
        Java Plugin.</strong></p>
    <p>Does that mean future Java 6 and 7 updates won't be able to run
      browser-based applications?&nbsp; The answer is no; these releases
      can still run Java web content, but they must be launched with the
      latest Java 8 update configured with <a

        Rule Sets</a>.&nbsp; Briefly, Deployment Rule Sets&nbsp;enable
      you&nbsp;to control the version of the JRE that is used for
      specific applications.&nbsp; In this scenario, the Latest (most
      secure) Java 8 update is&nbsp;launched when a user clicks on a
      link to start a web application.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Java 8
      plugin&nbsp;will consult the Deployment Rule Set, which contains a
      set of rules, to determine what to do next,&nbsp; If a rule exists
      to direct&nbsp;your application to run a specific version of Java,
      it will do so.&nbsp; If no rule exists, the rule set can be
      configured to block the application, thus assuring only those
      applications you trust can run.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this article is not to introduce you to Deployment
      Rule Sets; there are other&nbsp;excellent&nbsp;resources including
      this entry entitled <a

        Deployment Rule Sets</a>.&nbsp; Rather, the discussion today
      focuses on a critical step in creating rule sets, namely the <strong><em>requirement







          that the rule set be signed</em></strong>.&nbsp; The
      aforementioned article was written in 2013 when Deployment Rule
      Sets were first introduced.&nbsp; Java web application security
      has been further ratcheted up since, and the rule set signing
      section in the article only glosses over the steps required.</p>
    <p>To help facilitate&nbsp;the signing of Deployment Rule Sets, the
      following GitHub project has been created:</p>

    <p>Along with documentation and a sample ruleset,&nbsp;it includes a
      Windows Powershell script which automates the process.&nbsp; You
      can check out the project's <a
