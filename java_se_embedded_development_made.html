    Slowly but surely this old dog (who can learn new tricks, but at a
    snail's pace) came to the realization that although still quite
    relevant, a whole generation of people prefer not to read lengthy
    writings, but would rather digest information in small pieces using
    new media formats.&nbsp; Thus the rationale for the following
    blog...
    <p>Certainly no thespian when it comes to public speaking, I will
      say this:&nbsp; based upon my experience demonstrating Java SE on
      embedded devices, people have definitely expressed genuine
      interest.&nbsp; Maybe it was the cool device (i.e. Plug Computer)
      which was used, or maybe this combination of hardware and software
      inspired the audience to think of the possibilities presented by
      this new platform.&nbsp; Either way, I thought it might make sense
      to capture a shortened presentation/demonstration session.&nbsp;
      Following is a 30 minute session broken down into two 15 minute
      videos (because YouTube only allows videos of 15 minutes or less
      for mere mortals). They aim to demonstrate how developers already
      familiar with the Java SE development paradigm can leverage that
      knowledge to seamlessly develop on very capable embedded
      processors.&nbsp; Happy viewing!</p>
