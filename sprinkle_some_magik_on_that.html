    <b><big>Sprinkle Some Magik on that Java Virtual Machine</big></b><br>

    GE Energy, through its Smallworld subsidiary, has been providing
    geospatial software solutions to the utility and telco markets for
    over 20 years.&nbsp; One of the fundamental building blocks of their
    technology is a dynamically-typed object oriented programming
    language called <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magik_%28programming_language%29">Magik</a>.&nbsp;



    Like Java, Magik source code is compiled down to bytecodes that run
    on a virtual machine -- in this case the Magik Virtual Machine.
    <p>Throughout the years, GE has invested considerable engineering
      talent in the support and maintenance of this virtual
      machine.&nbsp; At the same time vast energy and resources have
      been invested in the Java Virtual Machine. The question for GE has
      been whether to continue to make that investment on its own or to
      leverage massive effort provided by the Java community? Utilizing
      the Java Virtual Machine instead of maintaining its own virtual
      machine would give GE more opportunity to focus on application
      solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>At last count, there are dozens, perhaps hundreds of examples of
      programming languages that have been hosted atop the Java Virtual
      Machine.&nbsp; Prior to the release of Java 7, that effort,
      although certainly possible, was generally less than optimal for
      languages like Magik because of its dynamic nature.&nbsp; Java, as
      a statically typed language had little use for this
      capability.&nbsp; In the quest to be a more universal virtual
      machine, Java 7, via <a
        href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292">JSR-292</a>,
      introduced a new bytecode called <font face="courier
        new,courier,monospace">invokedynamic</font>.&nbsp; In short, <font
        face="courier new,courier,monospace">invokedynamic</font>
      affords a more flexible method call mechanism needed by dynamic
      languages like Magik.</p>
    <p>With this new capability GE Energy has succeeded in hosting their
      Magik environment on top of the Java Virtual Machine.&nbsp; So you
      may ask, why would GE wish to do such a thing?&nbsp; The benefits
      are many:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Competitors to GE Energy claimed that the Magik environment
        was proprietary.&nbsp; By utilizing the Java Virtual Machine,
        that argument gets put to bed.&nbsp; JVM development is done in
        <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">open source</a>, where
        contributions are made world-wide by all types of organizations
        and individuals.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The unprecedented wealth of class libraries and applications
        written for the Java platform are now opened up to Magik/JVM
        platform as first class citizens.</li>
      <li>In addition, the Magik/JVM solution vastly increases the
        developer pool to include the 9 million Java developers -- the
        largest developer community on the planet.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Applications running on the JVM showed substantial performance
        gains, in some cases as much as a 5x speed up over the original
        Magik platform.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Legacy Magik applications can still run on the original
        platform.&nbsp; They can be seamlessly migrated to run on the
        JVM by simply recompiling the source code.<br>
      </li>
      <li>GE can now leverage the huge Java community.&nbsp; Undeniably
        the best virtual machine ever created, hundreds if not thousands
        of world class developers continually improve, poke, prod and
        scrutinize all aspects of the Java platform.&nbsp; As
        enhancements are made, GE automatically gains access to these.<br>
      </li>
      <li>As Magik has little in the way of support for multi-threading,
        GE will benefit from current and future Java offerings (e.g. <a
          href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/">lambda
          expressions</a>) that aim to further facilitate
        multi-core/multi-threaded application development.<br>
      </li>
      <li>As the JVM is available for many more platforms, it broadens
        the reach of Magik, including the potential to run on a class
        devices never envisioned just a few short years ago.&nbsp; For
        example, <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html">Java


          SE compatible runtime environments are available for popular
          embedded ARM/Intel/PowerPC configurations</a> that could
        theoretically host this software too.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    As compared to other JVM language projects, the Magik integration
    differs in that it represents a serious commercial entity betting a
    sizable part of its business on the success of this effort.&nbsp;
    Expect to see announcements not only from General Electric, but
    other organizations as they realize the benefits of utilizing the
    Java Virtual Machine.<br>
