    <b>Oracle JDK8 End of Public Updates: One Year Later</b><br>
    <small>by Jim Connors 16 January 2020</small><br>
    <p>Despite the fact that JDK 8 was introduced nearly six years ago
      (March 2014) and Oracle ended public support for JDK8 in January
      2019, JDK 8 still remains the most popular Java release. According
      to <a

        recent survey of nearly 400 developers</a>,&nbsp; nearly 60% of
      respondents continue to use Java 8 as their main version.&nbsp;
      Working with all manner of Java users and developers on a daily
      basis, I humbly believe the above mentioned survey results for
      Java 8 are on the low side.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Although developers
      are an enormously important lot, they only represent a small
      portion of the overall Java population.&nbsp; Developers by their
      very nature are more likely to be on the technological cutting
      edge whereas regular administrators, managers and users of Java
      applications tend more towards mainstream releases.&nbsp; And that
      release is unquestionably JDK 8.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This past Tuesday, 14 January 2020 effectively marks the one year
      anniversary of the post EoPU (End of Public Update) era for Oracle
      JDK 8.&nbsp; Oracle provided support and updates to JDK 8 for
      approximately five years and just like every other previous
      release dating back to the first Java release in 1996, ultimately
      ended public support in order to move on to newer releases.&nbsp;
      That being said Oracle continues to update <a

        href="https://www.oracle.com/JAVA/JAVA-SE-SUBSCRIPTION.HTML">JDK
        8 for it's commercial customers</a> and will continue to do so
      until at least March 2025.</p>
    <p>So what's changed since the January 2019 End of Public Update
      announcement?&nbsp; Oracle has released four quarterly Critical
      Patch Updates (CPUs), the most recent being on <a

        January 2020</a>. In that time span hundreds of bug fixes,
      enhancements and backports have been incorporated into the
      platform including <em><strong>42 patched security
          vulnerabilities</strong></em>.&nbsp; Without question, the
      vulnerability count will increase over time.&nbsp; If you're going
      to remain on JDK8 for the foreseeable future, as seems to be the
      case with an overwhelming number of organizations, is your
      organization aware of the security risks of older public
      versions?&nbsp; Might you have an interest in alleviating those
      risks by running a more secure update?</p>
