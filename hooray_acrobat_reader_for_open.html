    <p>Today truly marks a milestone in the history of Solaris for the
      x86/x64 platform.&nbsp; One of the most ubiquitous applications,
      Adobe Reader (notably Acrobat), is now available on [Open]Solaris
      for both Sparc and x86.</p>
    <p>It's been a long time coming, one argument for the lack of
      Solaris x86 support till now was that [Open]Solaris didn't have
      the critical mass.&nbsp; That's a hard one to swallow for the
      following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There's been a Solaris Sparc version for a long time.&nbsp;
        Solaris x86 downloads outnumber Sparc downloads by a large
        factor.</li>
      <li>Versions for AIX and HP-UX, which have a significantly smaller
        installed base, are available.&nbsp; Maybe IBM and HP payed a
        lot of money for this?</li>
      <li>Until recently there were versions even for the likes of OS/2
        and UnixWare.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Perhaps <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evince/">open source
        alternatives</a> are becoming good enough to pose a
      threat?&nbsp; Whatever the reason, we welcome the arrival of
      Acrobat Reader and Adobe's change of heart.</p>
    <p>You can get your copy <a

    <p>Happy Downloading!<br>
