    <p>Any modern x86/x64 processor worth its salt comes equipped with
      an <a title="Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APIC">Advanced Programmable
        Interrupt Controller</a>, or APIC.&nbsp; Among the features that
      an APIC provides is access to high resolution timers.&nbsp;
      Without such capability, the default interrupt source for timer
      and cyclic operations has a precision on the order of 10
      milliseconds -- hardly fine-grained enough for any serious
      real-time work.</p>
    <p>The <a title="cyclic subsystem"
        href="http://blogs.sun.com/eschrock/date/20041127">cyclic
        subsystem</a>, introduced in Solaris 8, gives Solaris the
      capability to support high resolution timers.&nbsp; The <a
        title="Sun Java Real-Time System"
        href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/index.jsp">Sun


        Java Real-Time System</a> version 2.0, available for Solaris on
      both x86 and Sparc platforms, includes an additional package
      called <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">SUNWrtjc</font>:&nbsp;


      <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">Java Real-Time System
        cyclic driver</font>.&nbsp; This package exposes an interface to
      the cyclic subsystem, normally only available to the kernel.&nbsp;
      For those already familiar with Sun's Java RTS, you've no doubt
      noticed that you either need to run as superuser or assign a set
      of fine-grained privileges to an ordinary user account. (<font
        face="courier new,courier,monospace">sys_res_config,
        proc_priocntl, proc_lock_memory</font><i> </i>and<i> </i><font
        face="courier new,courier,monospace">proc_clock_highres</font><i>).&nbsp;


      </i>The<i> </i><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">proc_clock_highres</font>
      privilege gives access to those timers.<i><br>
      </i></p>
    <p>Originally developed on an AMD Athlon-based PC, I recently moved
      a Real-Time Java project over to my Toshiba Tecra A1 laptop
      running the same version of Solaris and Java RTS.&nbsp; With the
      goal of getting in a little development time during a long flight,
      that migration suddenly casued timings to be all wrong.&nbsp; Why,
      might you ask, would moving an application from one seemingly
      identical Solaris environment to another cause this unusual
      behavior?&nbsp; Turns out that even though the laptop, a Pentium
      4M based system, has an APIC, it was never exposed by the laptop
      BIOS.&nbsp; In this scenario, regardless what you do from a
      Solaris perspective, you'll never get access to the high-res
      timers.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This phenomenon appears to be most prevelant in laptops.&nbsp; As
      they account for about 50% (or more?) of PCs sold today,
      developers have a realistic chance of running into this
      situation.&nbsp; You can issue this magic Solaris incantation to
      determine if your system has high-res timer support:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace"># echo
        "psm_timer_reprogram::print"&nbsp; | mdb -k</font><br>
      <br>
      If anything but '<font face="courier new,courier,monospace">apic_timer_reprogram</font>'
      is then displayed, your machine has no exposed APIC, and is
      probably unsuitable for Java RTS.&nbsp; In some cases the BIOS may
      be configurable with regards to APIC support; in many others it is
      simply not available.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the absence of an APIC, there is the potential to improve the
      high-resolution timing by setting the following tunable in <font
        face="courier new,courier,monospace">/etc/system</font>: <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">set
        hires_tick=1 </font><br>
      <br>
      Following a reboot, this would change the clock tick frequency
      from 100 to 1000 ticks per second. This frequency can then be
      further tuned by setting the hires_hz tunable to the desired
      value: <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">set
        hires_hz=10000</font> <br>
      <br>
      The default value is 1000 ticks per second; higher values are not
      officially supported. <br>
      <br>
      Note that tuning your machine in this way does not come without
      cost.&nbsp; It is likely to degrade overall performance, as the
      system will need to spend a larger proportion of time handling the
      larger frequency of clock interrupts.<sup>1</sup></p>
