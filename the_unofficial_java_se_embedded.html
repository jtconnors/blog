    <p> <big><b>The Unofficial Java SE Embedded SDK</b></big><br>
      <small><small>By Jim Connors 15 March 2011</small></small><br>
    </p>
    <p>Developing applications for embedded platforms gets simpler all
      the time, thanks in part to the tremendous advances in
      microprocessor design and software tools.&nbsp; And in particular,
      with the availability of Java SE compatible Virtual Machines for
      the popular embedded platforms, development has never been more
      straightforward.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The real beauty behind Java SE Embedded development lies in the
      fact that you can use your favorite IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans,
      JDeveloper ...) to create, test and debug code in the <strong><em>identical</em></strong>
      fashion in which you'd develop a standard desktop or server
      application.&nbsp; When the time comes to try it out on a Java SE
      Embedded capable device, it's just a matter of shipping the
      bytecodes over to the device and letting it run.&nbsp; There is no
      need for complicated emulators, toolchains and
      cross-compilers.&nbsp; The exact same bytecodes that ran on your
      PC, run <em><strong>unmodified</strong></em> on the embedded
      device.</p>
    <p>In fact, because all versions of Java SE (embedded or not) share
      a considerable amount of common code, we have plenty of anecdotal
      evidence which supports the notion that behavior -- correct or
      incorrect -- manifests itself identically across platforms.&nbsp;
      We refer specifically here to bugs.&nbsp; Now no one wants bugs,
      but believe it or not, our customers like the fact that behavior
      is consistent across platforms whether it's right or not. "Bug for
      bug compatibility" has actually become a strong selling point!</p>
    <p>Having espoused the virtues of transparently developing off
      device, many still wish to test and debug on-device regularly as
      part of their development cycle.&nbsp; If you're the touchy/feely
      type, there are ample examples of affordable and supported
      off-the-shelf devices that could fit the bill for an <em>Unofficial



        Java SE Embedded SDK</em>.&nbsp; One such platform is the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_computer">Plug Computer</a>.</p>
    <p><img src="resource/java_se-e/plug.jpg" width="106" height="94"><img
        src="resource/java_se-e/plug2.jpg" width="130" height="74"> The
      reference platform for the Plug Computer is supplied by <a
        href="http://www.marvell.com/company/news/pressDetail.do?releaseID=1321">Marvell



        Technology Group</a>. Manufacturers then license the technology
      from Marvell to create their own specific implementations.&nbsp;
      Two such vendors are <a
        href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/">GlobalScale</a>
      and <a href="http://www.ionicsgroup.com/">Ionics</a>.&nbsp; These
      are incredibly capable devices that include Arm processors in the
      1.2GHz to 2.0GHz range, and sport 512MB of RAM and flash.&nbsp;
      There are a host of external port and interface options including
      USB, ÂµUSB, SATA, GBE, SD, WiFi, ZigBee, Z-Wave and soon
      HDMI.&nbsp; Additionally, several Linux distros are available for
      these systems too.&nbsp; The typical cost for a base model is $99,
      and perhaps the most disruptive aspect of these systems,<em> they
        consume on average about 5 watts of power</em>.</p>
    <p>Alongside developing in the traditional manner, the ability to
      step through and examine state on these devices via remote
      debugging comes as a standard feature with the Java SE-E VM.&nbsp;
      Furthermore, you can use the JConsole application from your
      desktop to remotely monitor performance and resource consumption
      on the device.<br>
    </p>
    <p>So what would a bill of materials look like for <em>The
        Unofficial Java SE Embedded SDK</em>?&nbsp; Pretty simple
      actually:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">Latest
          NetBeans Java SE IDE</a> (or any other of your favorite Java
        IDEs)&nbsp;</li>
      <li><a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/java-se-embedded-archive-1862184.html">Java



          SE Embedded ARMv5 Linux - Headless</a></li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.ionicsgroup.com/">Ionics Nimbus 100</a>
        or <a
href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/p-22-sheevaplug-dev-kit-us.aspx">GlobalScale



          SheevaPlug Dev Kit</a></li>
    </ul>
    That's about it.&nbsp; Of course, for higher level functionality,
    you can add additional packages.&nbsp; For example, <a
      href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> runs
    beautifully here.&nbsp; Could anyone imagine a large number of these
    devices acting as a parallel web server?<br>
